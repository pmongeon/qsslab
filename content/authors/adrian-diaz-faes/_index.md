# Bio
I am a Senior Researcher at INGENIO, a joint research institute of CSIC and the Polytechnic University of València (UPV) in Spain. I am also affiliated with CWTS (Leiden University, the Netherlands) as a visiting scholar. I have a multidisciplinary background with a PhD and MSc in Applied Multivariate Statistics and a BA in Library and Information Science from the University of Salamanca.

My research contributes to three broad areas: science policy, research evaluation, and innovation management. The underlying theme of my trajectory is to deepen the understanding of scientific knowledge generation processes and innovation, which I address through different perspectives and research methods, including social network analysis, bibliometrics, multivariate analysis, econometrics, and survey research. My current interests revolve around how scientists' network mobilization strategies affect their ability to generate new knowledge and applied results and the development of quantitative methods to better understand science-society interactions, knowledge dissemination and use.
