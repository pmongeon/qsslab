# Bio
My name is Rowan and I am a Master of Information student at Dalhousie University. I hold a BA from the University of Ottawa in History where I developed an interest in archives and interdisciplinary research approaches for humanities disciplines. My current interests are industry funding in food research and food information behaviours.
