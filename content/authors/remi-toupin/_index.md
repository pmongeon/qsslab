# Bio
Finishing a PhD in Science, technologie et société at UQAM in Montreal, my work focuses on the public communication of research through social media with an interest for environmental such as climate change and marine biodiversity. My thesis adresses the contexts of climate change research communication on Twitter, specifically the publics involved and their relationships with one another. Within the QSS Lab, I work on the topical and social structure of shark research communication using social network analysis, with more projects focusing on ocean science as well as public health issues coming on. In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, cycling, swimming, anything that makes me discover our environment.
