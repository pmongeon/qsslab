# About Me

I am a first-year Master of Information student at Dalhousie University. I hold an honours BSc from the University of Guelph where I studied Nutritional and Nutraceutical Science, with a minor in International Development. I am passionate about interdisciplinary and scientific literacy. My interests include health science librarianship, evidence synthesis, and scholarly communication.
