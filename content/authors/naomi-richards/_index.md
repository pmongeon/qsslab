# About me

In 2020 I completed my Bachelor of Biology from the University of British Columbia. Currently, I am a Master of Information student at Dalhousie University. I have many research interests, including exploring the concept of social media as an avenue of knowledge dissemination. I am excited to be involved in research in the field of information science!
