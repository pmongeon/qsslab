# About me
I am an assistant professor at the [School of Information Management](https://www.dal.ca/faculty/management/school-of-information-management.html) 
at Dalhousie University, director of the Quantitative Science Studies Lab, 
associate member of the [Centre interuniversitaire de recherche sur la science et la technologie (CIRST)](https://www.cirst.uqam.ca/en/)
and a member of the [Environmental Infomration: Use and Influence (EIUI)](https://eiui.ca) research group.

My research uses bibliometric and other quantitative methods to study the dynamics and practices of knowledge production, dissemination and use, as well as research evaluation and governance. More specifically, I work on a broad range of topics, such as research collaboration, scientific misconduct, scholarly publishing, data sharing, research funding, social media, networks, and the evolution of scientific fields. I like to adopt a critical perspective in my research, teaching, and service as I strive to help the scientific communities better fulfill their societal roles.
