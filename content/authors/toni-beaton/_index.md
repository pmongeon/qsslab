# About Me

My name is Toni Beaton, and I am excited to be a part of the QSS Lab this year. I am a first-year student in the Master of Information program at Dalhousie University. I currently hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology (2013), as well as a Bachelor of Elementary Education degree (2014), both from the University of Saskatchewan. I bring with me over six years of international teaching experience, and a keen interest in the area of research-based evidence for educational best-practices, specifically for literacy education and development. I am also very interested in the fields of archival and records management, and hope to acquire knowledge and experience regarding these areas.
