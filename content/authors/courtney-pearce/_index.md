# About me

My name is Courtney Pearce and I am a Master of Information student at Dalhousie University. I completed a BA from Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador with a major in Linguistics in 2022. I am mainly interested in researching how information and society intersect, particularly in the library setting. In addition to that, My other interests include new technology that could be used for information storage, retrieval, and organization, the misuse of information, and how the rise of the web influences information management and librarianship as a whole.
