# About Maddie

Maddie Hare is a PhD student in the Digital Transformation & Innovation program at the University of Ottawa. She graduated from Dalhousie in 2017, 2021, and 2023, respectively with her BA and MA (both in History) and her MI. Maddie seeks to use bibliometrics to illuminate the dynamics and evolution of scholarly communities, and the global scientific research system more broadly. She is intrigued by ongoing developments in Open Science and scholarly publishing and combines these topics with her interest in the processes of learning and teaching in higher education, and the importance of fostering multiple types of literacies in researchers. She believes in bridging disciplinary divides to develop innovative approaches to real-world challenges.
