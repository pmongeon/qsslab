# Bio
Hello! My name is Rebecca, and in September 2023 I started the Master of Information program at Dalhousie University. I completed a Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology from the University of Calgary and spent 6 years working as an undergraduate and graduate researcher in the Sport Injury Prevention Research Centre. I'm interested in the role that academic journals play in the dissemination of research, and by extension access to research, incentives and unintended consequences in the journal publication system. In my free time, I can be found paddle boarding, trail running, practicing aerial silks skills, knitting, or baking.
