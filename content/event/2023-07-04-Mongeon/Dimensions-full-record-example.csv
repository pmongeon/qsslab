Through a questionnaire survey, the construction of the knowledge management model of construction-related enterprises and engineering cost consulting enterprises is discussed. First, through the analysis and discussion of ontology-based data mining (OBDM) algorithm and association analysis (Apriori) algorithm, a data mining algorithm (ML-AR algorithm) on account of ontology-based multilayer association and machine learning is proposed. The performance of the various algorithms is compared and analyzed. Second, based on the knowledge management level, analysis and statistics are conducted on the levels of knowledge acquisition, sharing, storage, and innovation. Finally, according to the foregoing, the knowledge management model based on engineering cost consulting enterprises is built and analyzed. The results show that the reliability coefficient of this questionnaire is above 0.8, and the average extracted value is above 0.7, verifying excellent reliability and validity. The efficiency of the ML-AR algorithm at both the number of transactions and the support level is better than the other two algorithms, which is expected to be applied to the enterprise knowledge management model. There is a positive correlation between each level of knowledge management; among them, the positive correlation between knowledge acquisition and knowledge sharing is the strongest. The enterprise knowledge management model has a positive impact on promoting organizational innovation capability and industrial development. The research work provides a direction for the development of enterprise knowledge management and the improvement of innovation ability.","(1)Major theoretical and practical issues of social science planning of Shandong Province in 2018, Study on the network effect of Airport Economic Zone in Shandong Province and the new kinetic energy of the development of air transport industry, 18CSJJ10.

With a case study from Chengdu-Chongqing Economic Circle of China, this paper attempts to empirically justify the framework. An index system was established for evaluating CKMC based on BSC and knowledge management process, the weight design and consistency check of the indexes were implemented by using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), and the overall evaluation value and concrete index scores at all levels were obtained via the fuzzy evaluation method. Empirical results show that CKMC performance measurement indicators were ranked in order of importance as Business process performance dimensions (0.465), System support dimensions (0.289), Customer communication dimensions (0.152) and Market performance dimension (0.094). It also shows that the overall score of CKMC was 3.404, reflecting that the CKMC was in a state of general satisfaction. This research also identifies key factors hindering implementation of CKMC, including Attention from senior leaders (2.871), customer knowledge sharing efficiency (2.928), and information technology level (3.133). This research could contribute to CKM theory by extending customer knowledge management competence research with BSC initiatively. For practitioners, this study may provide useful suggestions to identify key factors promoting business CKMC, and finally promotes sustainable development of Agritourism.",,"Social Organization Project of Chongqing Federation of Social Sciences, No.2021SZ24, Guoyi Chen Humanities and Social Sciences Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, No.17SKG163, Guoyi Chen Humanities and Social Sciences Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, No.17SKG155, Jiansheng Zhang Humanities and Social Sciences Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, No.22SKGH338, Guoyi Chen Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, No.KJQN202101213, Guoyi Chen Graduate Education and Teaching Reform Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, No.yjg223131, Guoyi Chen Higher Education Teaching Reform Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, No.223297, Guoyi Chen Higher Education Research Program of Chongqing Three Gorges University, No.GJ202210, Guoyi Chen Foundation of Intelligent Ecotourism Subject Group of Chongqing Three Gorges University, No.zhlv20221022, Wei Tan The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.",PLOS ONE,,Knowledge Management; Analytic Hierarchy Process; Commerce; Information Science; Records,2023-02-09,2023,2023-02-09,,18,2,e0280482,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chen, Guoyi; Zhang, Jiansheng; Tan, Wei; Zhang, Shangmin; Yan, Bangquan","Chen, Guoyi (School of Business Management, Chongqing Three Gorges University, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China); Zhang, Jiansheng (Scientific Research Department, Chongqing Three Gorges University, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China); Tan, Wei (School of Public Management, Chongqing Three Gorges University, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China); Zhang, Shangmin (School of Business Management, Chongqing Three Gorges University, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China); Yan, Bangquan (School of Business Management, Chongqing Three Gorges University, Wanzhou, Chongqing, China)","Chen, Guoyi (Chongqing Three Gorges University)","Chen, Guoyi (Chongqing Three Gorges University); Zhang, Jiansheng (Chongqing Three Gorges University); Tan, Wei (Chongqing Three Gorges University); Zhang, Shangmin (Chongqing Three Gorges University); Yan, Bangquan (Chongqing Three Gorges University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0280482&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155251350,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4609 Information Systems",

However, despite the rapid growth of research in this area, few attempts have been made to review previous research. This study tried to summarize the opportunities and challenges of using social media to managing health knowledge.
METHODOLOGY: This article used a narrative approach to collect and review studies. In this review, published documents during 2010-2019 were retrieved by search in the following three electronic scientific databases: Web of Knowledge, PubMed, and Google Scholar search engine using keywords including social media, public health, health knowledge, knowledge management, and health promotion.
RESULTS: Social media by overcoming geographical barriers, developing health promotion, facilitating decision-making, and providing public health education has been able to enhancing health awareness and improving health behavior. Doctors' unwillingness to interact with the public, lack of compliance with the principles of medical ethics, users' privacy concerns, and difficulty of managing negative comments are the four challenges to health knowledge management in social media.
CONCLUSION: Social media can be a suitable tool for developing health knowledge management processes if medical professional ethics and users' privacy managed properly.","This study is part of a dissertation for a PhD degree in medical librarianship and information sciences approved (Code: IUMS/SHMIS_1396-9321623001) in Iran University of Medical Sciences, Iran.",,Journal of Education and Health Promotion,,,2020-06-30,2020,2020-06-30,2020,9,1,144,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ghalavand, Hossein; Panahi, Sirous; Sedghi, Shahram","Ghalavand, Hossein (Department of Medical Library and Information Science, School of Health Management and Information Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Abadan, Iran; Department of Medical Library and Information Science, Abadan Faculty of Medical Sciences, Abadan); Panahi, Sirous (Department of Medical Library and Information Science, School of Health Management and Information Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Abadan, Iran; Department of Medical Library and Information Science, Health Management and Economics Research Center, School of Health Management and Information Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran); Sedghi, Shahram (Department of Medical Library and Information Science, School of Health Management and Information Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Abadan, Iran; Department of Medical Library and Information Science, Health Management and Economics Research Center, School of Health Management and Information Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran)","Panahi, Sirous (Iran University of Medical Sciences; Iran University of Medical Sciences)","Ghalavand, Hossein (Iran University of Medical Sciences); Panahi, Sirous (Iran University of Medical Sciences; Iran University of Medical Sciences); Sedghi, Shahram (Iran University of Medical Sciences; Iran University of Medical Sciences)",14,8,0.96,5.73,https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_754_19,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128966392,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,

Knowledge management and intellectual capital are powerful tools to promote innovation in the organization. Therefore, this study aims to explore the influence of knowledge management process and intellectual capital on innovation with the mediating effect of entrepreneurial orientation and moderating role of leader education level. Data were collected from a sample of 393 IT firms listed in the Pakistan Software Houses Association and applied a partial least squares structural educational modeling (SEM) technique. The results show that the knowledge management process and intellectual capital have a positive effect on innovation. Moreover, the study confirms that entrepreneurial orientation partially mediates the relationship between knowledge management and intellectual capital on innovation. Furthermore, the moderation effect of a leader's education was confirmed for the knowledge management-innovation relationship whereas, the moderation effect of the leader's education on intellectual capital and innovation relationship was insignificant.

To keep expanding, the resulting information and data must be collected in a single area and shared throughout society. Knowledge developed in academic institutions is not adequately preserved or gathered, according to research. It has also been observed that the majority of the content or knowledge developed in academic institutes is unknown to the general public and is categorized as a literature review, which may be useful if proper coding is kept in the organization. The purposeful integration of humans, processes, and technology dedicated to developing, capturing, and executing an organization's creative infrastructure is known as a Knowledge Management (KM) method. Knowledge Management supports educational institutes in refining their capability to acquire and share information and knowledge, applying it to problem resolution and promoting research and continuous development. This paper advocates a holistic strategy for finding, analyzing, recording, retrieving, and distributing the whole of an administration's data properties. Databases, records, procedures, regulations and hitherto un-captured knowledge and talent in ordinary employees are samples of these properties.

Knowledge management facilitates institutions to enhance the capacity to collect information and knowledge and apply it to problem-solving and decision making. Through the review of related studies, we observed that there are multiple concepts and terms in the field of knowledge management. Thus, the complexity and variety of these concepts and definitions must be clarified. Considering the importance of clarifying these concepts for utilization by users, this study aimed to examine the concepts related to this filed. Methods: The methodology used in this study was based on the Carnwell and Daly's critical review method. An extensive search was carried out on various databases and libraries. A critical and profound review was carried out on selected articles. Many wandering concepts were found. Identified concepts were classified into seven categories based on conceptual proximity. Existing definitions and evidence in relation to extracted concepts were criticized and synthesized. The definitional attributes for them were identified and a conceptual identity card was provided for each of the concepts. Results: Thirty-seven concepts with the most relevance to the field of knowledge management were extracted. There was no clear boundary among them, and they wandered. To avoid more confusion, concepts were classified according to semantic relation. Eight categories were created; each category consisted of a mother concept and several other concepts with similarity and proximity to the meaning of the original concept. Their attributes have been identified, and finally, each of them was presented in the form of a conceptual identity card. Conclusion: Through critically reviewing the literature in this field, we were able to identify the concepts and realize their attributes. In this way, we came to a new interpretation of the concepts. At the end of the study, we concluded that some of the concepts have not been properly defined and are not properly located in the knowledge management field; also their application is uncertain.",,,Medical Journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran,,,2020-09-28,2020,2020-09-28,,34,,127-127,Closed,Article,"Yazdani, Shahram; Bayazidi, Snor; Mafi, Amir Ali","Yazdani, Shahram (Virtual school of Medical Education and Management, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran); Bayazidi, Snor (Virtual school of Medical Education and Management, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran); Mafi, Amir Ali (Anesthesiology Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran)","Bayazidi, Snor (Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences)","Yazdani, Shahram (Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences); Bayazidi, Snor (Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences); Mafi, Amir Ali (Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134471991,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,

To produce the necessary pooled correlation matrix for model testing, we used the univariate (r) approach to carry out two additional meta-analyzes. Based on data collected from several research databases, we extracted the paired correlation coefficients (r) among knowledge management processes (k = 32, N = 6835) then the inter-correlations between knowledge management processes and culture types (k = 7, N = 865). The findings revealed that no particular culture type has a stronger effect on all KM processes. Clan, Adhocracy and Market have significant but varying effects on Knowledge Management processes. Notably, the clan is more associated with knowledge creation, while Adhocracy has a greater effect on knowledge application, and market has a stronger effect on knowledge dissemination and storage. However, hierarchical culture has an insignificant effect on knowledge creation and the lowest effects on the rest of Knowledge Management processes. Therefore, the study concluded that knowledge management success is determined by developing a balanced portfolio of cultural traits from clan, adhocracy and market cultures.",,"The authors extend their appreciation to the General Directorate of Scientific Research and Technological Development (GDSRTD), Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, Algeria, to fund this work.",Frontiers in Psychology,,,2022-05-30,2022,2022-05-30,,13,,856234,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aichouche, Riad; Chergui, Khalil; Brika, Said Khalfa Mokhtar; Mezher, Mohammed El; Musa, Adam; Laamari, Ahmed","Aichouche, Riad (Department of Management Sciences, Faculty of Economics, Commercial and Management Sciences, COFIFAS Laboratory, University of Oum El Bouaghi, Oum El Bouaghi, Algeria); Chergui, Khalil (Department of Management Sciences, Faculty of Economics, Commercial and Management Sciences, COFIFAS Laboratory, University of Oum El Bouaghi, Oum El Bouaghi, Algeria); Brika, Said Khalfa Mokhtar (Department of Administrative Sciences, Applied College, University of Bisha, Bisha, Saudi Arabia); Mezher, Mohammed El (Department of Administrative Sciences, Applied College, University of Bisha, Bisha, Saudi Arabia); Musa, Adam (Department of Administrative Sciences, Applied College, University of Bisha, Bisha, Saudi Arabia); Laamari, Ahmed (Faculty of Science and Arts, University of Bisha, Bisha, Saudi Arabia)","Brika, Said Khalfa Mokhtar (University of Bisha)","Aichouche, Riad (Larbi Ben M'hidi University of Oum El Bouaghi); Chergui, Khalil (Larbi Ben M'hidi University of Oum El Bouaghi); Brika, Said Khalfa Mokhtar (University of Bisha); Mezher, Mohammed El (University of Bisha); Musa, Adam (University of Bisha); Laamari, Ahmed (University of Bisha)",0,0,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.856234/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148258172,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,

The current study examines the changes required in companies' quality systems to enhance intergenerational learning and knowledge retention. Our primary objective was to understand the factors that influence the development of an organizational culture encouraging innovation, knowledge sharing, organizational learning, openness, and providing opportunities to create up-to-date knowledge. We collected the viewpoints and needs of industry professionals by using interviews and a survey. Then, we analyzed the factors that influence knowledge management quality and transfer between workforce generations. The professionals' primary goal is to introduce, integrate, and improve knowledge in their organization. Their second goal is to facilitate knowledge sharing and transfer between workforce generations. Improving transgenerational knowledge sharing and reducing the loss of knowledge are challenges for all industries.

The aim of this study to investigate the relationship between information technology capabilities (ITCs) and green product innovation (GPI). The information technology (IT) capabilities with multiple dimensions, such as IT competence, IT integration, and IT infrastructure, were used in this paper. Moreover, to verify the deep relationship between ITCs and GPI, we used knowledge management (KM) as a mediator. The data were collected through a questionnaire from the senior managers, middle-level managers, and operational staff associated with the small- and medium-sized production industry of Pakistan. We collect data in two waves between January 2022 and July 2022. The data were analyzed through the partial least square structural equation modeling through SmartPLS 3.2.2. The findings of this study conclude. First, in the direct relationship, two IT capabilities, such as IT competence and IT infrastructure, have a positive and significant direct relationship with green product innovation, but IT integration has an insignificant relationship with green product innovation. Second, the results show that three IT capabilities have positively influenced knowledge management. Third, the results confirm that KM has a significant positive effect on GPI. Finally, the outcomes confirmed that knowledge management positively and significantly mediates between all IT capabilities and GPI in the indirect relationship.",,"This paper is financially supported by the project 2106/2023 grant âDeterminants of Cognitive Processes Impacting the Work Performanceâ granted by the University of Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.

Social capital provides a good basis for more productive human resources, and training hospitals also play a key role in the health-care system. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between knowledge management and social capital with organizational health in selected educational hospitals of Tehran in 2018.
METHODS: This analytical cross-sectional study was performed on 310 medical staff of hospitals using proportional sampling method. The data gathering tools consisted of three standard questionnaires of knowledge management, social capital, and organizational health. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics using SPSS version 22 software.
RESULTS: Most participants in this study were male (8/66%) and in the age group 31-36 years. The mean of knowledge management and organizational health were 3.43 and 3.49, respectively. There is a significant direct relationship between knowledge management components and organizational health. Moreover, there is a significant but weak direct relationship between knowledge management and social capital with organizational health dimensions (P â¤ 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Considering the relationship between knowledge management and social capital with organizational health, enhancing the level of organizational health can help to improve the dimensions of knowledge management and social capital. It is suggested that hospital managers, using knowledge management and social capital components, enhance organizational health so that the hospital is more prepared to adapt to the complexities and changes in the market providing services.","The authors of this study sincerely thank the managers, officials, and staff of the educational hospitals involved in the research and all those who patiently assisted the research team in this study.",,Journal of Education and Health Promotion,,,2020-02-28,2020,2020-02-28,,9,,29,Closed,Article,"Aryankhesal, Aidin; Hasani, Mahdi; Niknam, Noureddin; Safari, Mehdi; Ranaei, Asaad; Kalteh, Ehsan Allah","Aryankhesal, Aidin (Department of Health Services Management, School of Health Management and Information Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.); Hasani, Mahdi (Department of Health Services Management, School of Health Management and Information Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.); Niknam, Noureddin (Department of Health Services Management, School of Health Management and Information Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.); Safari, Mehdi (Ph.D. Candidate of Health in Disasters and Emergencies, School of Health Management and Information Sciences, International Campus (IUMS-IC), Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.; Department of Health in Disasters and Emergencies, School of Public Health and Safety, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.); Ranaei, Asaad (Department of Health Services Management, School of Health Management and Information Sciences, Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.); Kalteh, Ehsan Allah (Health Management and Social Development Research Center, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran.)","Hasani, Mahdi (Iran University of Medical Sciences)","Aryankhesal, Aidin (Iran University of Medical Sciences); Hasani, Mahdi (Iran University of Medical Sciences); Niknam, Noureddin (Iran University of Medical Sciences); Safari, Mehdi (Iran University of Medical Sciences; Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences); Ranaei, Asaad (Iran University of Medical Sciences); Kalteh, Ehsan Allah (Golestan University of Medical Sciences)",5,2,1.06,2.3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126818077,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Therefore, nursing professionals can utilize key strategies of knowledge management to support clinical decision making, reorganize nursing actions, and maximize patient outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of knowledge management-based nursing care educational training on HAI prevention behavior at the High Care Unit (HCU) of Saiful Anwar Hospital Malang.
METHODS: A quasiexperimental design with a pretest, educational training intervention, and posttest were conducted on 15 nurses in the HCU of Saiful Anwar Hospital Malang, which lasted for 16 days. Furthermore, observation of nursing care documentation, nurses' handwashing compliance, and presence of infection-causing bacteria in the HCU staff and environment (hands rub handle, medical record, and patient's bed) was carried out pre (day 1-7) and post training (day 10-16). Subsequently, educational training related to knowledge management-based nursing care was conducted for 2 days (day 8-9) by the Doktor Mengabdi Team of Universitas Brawijaya.
RESULTS: The knowledge level and completeness of the nursing care documentation in the HCU room significantly increased after the training (pâ<â.05). Also, compliance to the six steps five moments of nurses' handwashing increased after the training (pâ>â.05). Infection-causing bacteria were found in the HCU environment and staff before and after the training involving Pseudomonas stutzeri, Sphingomonas paucimobilis, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pasteurella pneumotropica, and Acinetobacter lwoffii. Therefore, increased knowledge of HCU nurses and complete documentation (râ=â.890; pâ=â.054), increased knowledge of HCU nurses and handwashing compliance (râ=â.770; pâ=â.086), and handwashing compliance and bacterial presence (râ=â.816; pâ=â.084) all had a positive correlation.
CONCLUSION: Knowledge management-based nursing care educational training increased infection prevention behavior in the HCU of Saiful Anwar Hospital Malang.","The authors are grateful to Lembaga Penelitian dan Pengabdian Masyarakat (LPPM), Universitas Brawijaya, for facilitating and financing this community service research in Doktor Mengabdi Program 2018.

It also explores the moderating role of inter-functional integration. We have collected the data from the 308 supply chain managers of pharmaceutical firms in Pakistan and questionnaires were used for data collection with multi-item scales already developed and validated. The findings suggest that knowledge management capacities significantly influence a firm's competitive advantage or supply chain agility. The supply chain agility fully mediates between absorptive capacity, transformative capacity, and firm competitive advantage. Further, supply chain agility partially mediates between inventive capacity and firm competitive advantage. Meanwhile, inter-functional integration moderates the relationship between supply chain agility and firm competitive advantage, with their positive relationship strengthening when inter-functional integration is high. The study provides empirical evidence that knowledge management capacities (such as absorptive capacity, transformative capacity, and inventive capacity), supply chain agility, and inter-functional can be important factors in improving firm performance.",,"This research was supported by the University Research Innovation Fund of Science and Technology Development Center of the Ministry of Education of China (2020ITA05022), the Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province (2021CFB316), the Preliminary Support Project of Hubei Social Science Foundation (21ZD137), and the Hundreds of Schools Unite with Hundreds of Counties-University Serving Rural Revitalization Science and Technology Support Action Plan (BXLBX0847).",Frontiers in Public Health,,Commerce; Inventions; Knowledge Management; Pakistan; Pharmaceutical Preparations,2022-07-05,2022,2022-07-05,,10,,953478,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hu, Zhihua; Sarfraz, Muddassar; Khawaja, Kausar Fiaz; Shaheen, Hina; Mariam, Shahida","Hu, Zhihua (Department of Computer Science, Huanggang Normal University, Huanggang, China); Sarfraz, Muddassar (School of Management, Zhejiang Shuren University, Hangzhou, China); Khawaja, Kausar Fiaz (Faculty of Management Sciences, International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan); Shaheen, Hina (Faculty of Management Sciences, International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan); Mariam, Shahida (Faculty of Management Sciences, International Islamic University, Islamabad, Pakistan)","Sarfraz, Muddassar (Zhejiang Shuren University)","Hu, Zhihua (Huanggang Normal University); Sarfraz, Muddassar (Zhejiang Shuren University); Khawaja, Kausar Fiaz (International Islamic University, Islamabad); Shaheen, Hina (International Islamic University, Islamabad); Mariam, Shahida (International Islamic University, Islamabad)",4,4,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.953478/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149238090,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,

The data were acquired from 378 managerial level personnel of the construction industry in China through questionnaires. Smart-PLS 3.3.3 was used to determine the study's hypothesis through the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. The study found that KM practice has a significant relationship with a sustainable environment, environmental awareness, and green technological use. Also, environmental awareness has a significant effect on a sustainable environment. Moreover, it was found in the study that environmental awareness significantly mediated the relationship between KM practices and sustainable environment, but green technological use did not find any mediating effect on the relationship between KM practices and sustainable environment. Furthermore, green innovative culture considerably moderated the relationship between KM practices and a sustainable environment. Theoretically, this study contributes to the existing literature by incorporating and investigating the role of KM practices in a sustainable environment. Practically, this article presented some implications for the management concerning promoting KM practices and environmental awareness within the organization and developing a green innovative culture.",,"This work was funded within the project No. (2019ZDWT14) entitled: Investigation and Research on the construction of Shaanxi new era civilization Practice Center, supported by Shaanxi Social Science Foundation.",Frontiers in Psychology,,,2022-04-07,2022,2022-04-07,,13,,861813,All OA; Gold,Article,"Weina, An; Yanling, Yang","Weina, An (College of Health Management, Xian Medical University, Xi'an, China); Yanling, Yang (Institute of Culture and History, Shaanxi Academy of Social Sciences, Xi'an, China)","Yanling, Yang ","Weina, An (Xi'an Medical University); Yanling, Yang ()",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.861813/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146938973,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 12 Responsible Consumption and Production

BACKGROUND: Although successful knowledge management improves the quality of care and performance of health care organisations, there is limited evidence on health care managers' competence in knowledge management EVALUATION: A scoping review was conducted by including original published and unpublished studies (qualitative, quantitative, and experimental) and review designs in English, Finnish, or Swedish. The studies were retrieved from six databases (CINAHL, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, Mednar, and Finnish database Medic) in November 2020 and then complemented in January 2022. Narrative synthesis was used to synthesize data.
KEY ISSUES: A total of 21 articles was included in the review. The main themes of managers' competence in knowledge management presented in these were system management, professional development, and leadership behaviour and attitude. No valid and reliable instruments were described in the included studies.
CONCLUSION: At present, there is a limited understanding of health care managers' competence in knowledge management. A comprehensive understanding of this topic can provide a direction for future research.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: The results can be utilized in the assessment and development of managers' competence in knowledge management, as well as the formulation of education and in-service training for health care managers.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors would like to thank the information specialist Sirpa Grekula from the University of Oulu for her help in developing a suitable search strategy for this review.

Knowledge management is an essential facilitator and common challenge in MHA services.
OBJECTIVE: This paper aimed to describe the development of a knowledge management system (KMS) and the associated processes in 1 MHA program. We also aimed to examine the uptake and use, satisfaction, and feedback on implementation among a group of pilot testers.
METHODS: This project was conducted as a continuous quality-improvement initiative. Integrated stakeholder engagement was used to scope the content and design the information architecture to be implemented using a commercially available knowledge management platform. A group of 30 clinical and administrative staff were trained and tested with the KMS over a period of 10 weeks. Feedback was collected via surveys and focus groups. System analytics were used to characterize engagement. The content, design, and full-scale implementation planning of the KMS were refined based on the results.
RESULTS: Satisfaction with accessing the content increased from baseline to after the pilot. Most testers indicated that they would recommend the KMS to a colleague, and satisfaction with KMS functionalities was high. A median of 7 testers was active each week, and testers were active for a median of 4 days over the course of the pilot. Focus group themes included the following: the KMS was a solution to problems for staff members, functionality of the KMS was important, quality content matters, training was helpful and could be improved, and KMS access was required to be easy and barrier free.
CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge management is an ongoing need in MHA services, and KMSs hold promise in addressing this need. Testers in 1 MHA program found a KMS that is easy to use and would recommend it to colleagues. Opportunities to improve implementation and increase uptake were identified. Future research is needed to understand the impact of KMSs on quality of care and organizational efficiency.","Funding for this project was provided by the Izaak Walton Killam Mental Health and Addiction Program through support from the Office of Addictions and Mental Health, Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness.

relevant to the topic was conducted. The study materials were rigorously
screened to limit any potential biases regarding their selection. Through the
study, the paper concludes that the fight against Covid-19 crisis indeed
requires knowledge to, among other things, find a lasting solution, mitigate the
impacts, limit misinformation, revert to normalcy, and plan for similar crises
in future. Further, the paper concludes that sustainable knowledge management
during the Covid-19 crisis largely depends on a decisive leadership style that
puts employees at the centre; a culture that embraces knowledge as a core asset,
and supportive ICT infrastructure. Furthermore, the study reveals that relevance
of ICT in the process of managing knowledge, largerly depends on a culture that
accepts knowledge as a critical resource. The study establishes some challenges
associated with ICT where a way forward for migrating from knowledge capture to
knowledge creation and sharing has been re-affirmed. The present paper has led
to the development of a model that further explains the relationships between
the determinants of leadership, culture and ICT against effective management of

Law enforcement agencies are struggling to keep pace with technological developments, cybercrime growth, and scientific advances. In federated environments, digital forensic knowledge and practices vary widely across regions. To reduce delays, wasted resources, missed opportunities, mistakes, and misinterpretations, there is a pressing need to balance the democratization of digital forensic capabilities with knowledge management and sharing between decentralized regions. There are multiple forms of knowledge to be managed, including procedural, technical, investigative, scientific, behavioral, crime analysis, and forensic intelligence. In addition, there are multiple knowledge producers and consumers, including police investigators, digital forensic practitioners, criminal intelligence analysts, attorneys, and judges. Knowledge management becomes even more challenging when multiple interdependent regions are involved, speaking different languages. Taking all of these factors into consideration, this work presents an inter-regional knowledge management solution for improving the quality, consistency, reliability, efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and return on investment of digital forensic capabilities. The basis of this work is a community-driven initiative of Swiss regional police authorities. Interviews were conducted with 15 digital forensic units to determine their current knowledge management practices and needs. The results were then generalized into a prioritized set of requirements for inter-regional digital forensic knowledge management that may be applicable in other countries. These requirements were used to evaluate knowledge management platforms, and one was selected.

        The COVIDâ19 global pandemic has adversely affected educational institutions worldwide, resulting in frequent mandatory lockdowns and social distancing rules. After waiting for a brief period, most organizations, including educational institutions, moved their operations from traditional inâclass to virtual, webâbased teachingâlearning. As a result of unprecedented change, faculty, students, and administrators faced several challenges. However, how the educational institutions were coping with this challenging situation remained an important question. To address this, we present Knowledge Management Process (KMP), Knowledge Management System Infrastructure (KMSINF), and Knowledge Management System Quality (KMSQU) as resilient strategies to convert the challenges into opportunities. Using the KM processes and practices, a complex model is constructed to positively influence employee commitment, performance, and job satisfaction. A survey instrument was used to collect data from 747 faculty members from 14 higher educational institutions in the southern part of India. After testing the measurement properties using the Lisrel package of structural equation modeling, the complex model was tested using Hayes PROCESS macros. The results indicate (i) KMP is positively related to performance and employee commitment, (ii) employee commitment mediates the relationship between KMP and performance, (iii) KMSINF moderates the relationship between KMP and employee commitment, (iv) KMSQU moderates the moderated relationship between KMP and KMSINF in influencing the employee commitment, and (v) performance is positively related to job satisfaction. The results suggest that KM processes, system infrastructure, and system quality are effective, resilient strategies to bring educational institutions to normal functioning during the present global pandemic. The implications for KM, employee commitment, and job satisfaction are discussed.",,,Knowledge and Process Management,,,2022-06-08,2022,2022-06-08,,,,,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Sivagnanam, Pavithra; Pillai, Arul Ramanatha; Elangovan, Rajesh; Parayitam, Satyanarayana","Sivagnanam, Pavithra (PG and Research Department of Commerce, St Joseph's College (Autonomous), Affiliated to Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India); Pillai, Arul Ramanatha (PG and Research Department of Commerce, St Joseph's College (Autonomous), Affiliated to Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India); Elangovan, Rajesh (Department of Commerce, Bishop Heber College (Autonomous), Affiliated to Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India); Parayitam, Satyanarayana (Department of Management and Marketing, Charlton College of Business, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, Dartmouth, Massachusetts, USA)","Parayitam, Satyanarayana (University of Massachusetts Dartmouth)","Sivagnanam, Pavithra (Bharathidasan University); Pillai, Arul Ramanatha (Bharathidasan University); Elangovan, Rajesh (Bharathidasan University); Parayitam, Satyanarayana (University of Massachusetts Dartmouth)",6,6,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/kpm.1722,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148515288,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

Given the efforts made to incorporate knowledge management into the occupational safety and health management system (OSH-MS), this research attempts to illustrate how the knowledge conversion processes are accomplished within key elements of the OSH-MS. Methods. This study uses concept mapping (CM) as an integrated approach for mirroring participants' viewpoints about the interaction between tacit and explicit knowledge in the OSH-MS. OSH and knowledge management experts of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) and its subdivisions were invited to complete the CM process. Results. Interpretation of the maps and graphical representations generated indicates that the concepts within the key elements of the OSH-MS are sorted into different clusters, including Knowledge Application, Knowledge Dissemination, Knowledge Socialization and Knowledge Presentation. Regarding the participants' ratings, the Knowledge Application cluster is rated as the most important, and Knowledge Socialization is rated as the most prevalent. Conversely, Knowledge Presentation is rated the least important and prevalent. Conclusions. The results simulated in MATLAB version R2018a and JMP version 13.2 help in better understanding the interplay between tacit and explicit knowledge in the key elements of the OSH-MS and clarify the potential programmable areas to improve organizational performance.","This study did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.",,International Journal of Occupational Safety and Ergonomics,,Humans; Iran; Knowledge; Occupational Health,2021-01-20,2021,2021-01-20,2022-04-03,28,2,1000-1015,Closed,Article,"Esmaeili, Negin; Soofi, Jahanyar Bamdad","Esmaeili, Negin (Faculty of Management and Accounting, Allameh Tabatabaâi University, Iran); Soofi, Jahanyar Bamdad (Faculty of Management and Accounting, Allameh Tabatabaâi University, Iran)","Soofi, Jahanyar Bamdad (Allameh Tabataba'i University)","Esmaeili, Negin (Allameh Tabataba'i University); Soofi, Jahanyar Bamdad (Allameh Tabataba'i University)",1,1,,1.22,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132790653,33 Built Environment and Design; 3303 Design; 44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration,

We advance this field by studying how an inclusive climate benefits organizational innovation, an important foundation for sustained competitive advantage. Adopting a synergy perspective, we examine the internal (i.e., workplace demographic diversity in terms of age, gender, and region) and external contingencies (i.e., environmental scanning and environmental uncertainty) for an inclusive climate to foster incremental and radical innovation through the mechanism of knowledge management capacity. We tested our research model with a three-wave data collection from multiple sources (i.e., employees, human resource managers, and executives) in 102 organizations. We found that workplace age and regional diversity (but not gender diversity) strengthened the positive effect of inclusive climate on knowledge management capacity, and subsequently incremental and radical innovation. The facilitating effect of environmental scanning was only significant for organizations that experienced higher environmental uncertainty. Our research highlights the importance of considering the synergistic potential of internal human resources and external environments for organizations to capitalize on their inclusive climate for knowledge management and innovation.

The pandemic has shown how family businesses (FBs) are solving complex problems faster than non-family. They have demonstrated the flexibility to transform and adapt because of their closeness to the firmâs processes and management and their social network inside and outside organizations that allow them to respond quickly to market needs based on a fast-making decisions process. FBsâ knowledge, which is embedded in their values, making decisions process, and remaining for generations, requires resilient and robust management. The relationship between family values and FB management differentiates by their complexity and generational aspect. These relations demonstrate that personal values can influence professionalization, succession, and innovation processes. In this regard, there is a lack of research to understand the findings, practices, and processes associated with managing the knowledge flows through which FBs execute innovation strategies and to build on professionalization and succession capabilities that could provide different avenues of innovation and adaptation for dealing with turbulent and uncertain times. This editorial intends to provoke discussion on what we know about family businesses and how they face different challenges in a complex world to survive.

A screening process resulted in a final sample of 78 papers published in open access, peer-review journals in the fields of public health management and knowledge management theories. Based on the results of the study, the Enablers of Patient Knowledge Empowerment for Self-Management of Chronic Disease Framework was created. It revealed that it is important to look at patient knowledge empowerment as a pathway across the empowerment levels through which both knowledge enablers identified in public health management theory and knowledge sharing enablers singled out in knowledge management theory operate. The integration of these two perspectives across patient empowerment levels uncovers a holistic framework for patient knowledge empowerment.",,"This research is funded by the European Social Fund under the No 09.3.3-LMT-K-712 âDevelopment of Competences of Scientists, other Researchers and Students through Practical Research Activitiesâ measure.

Accordingly, the competitive edge and long-term viability of businesses would depend on the knowledge workers who could overcome these excruciatingly difficult obstacles and have the knowledge and competency to influence the overall performance of any type of company. But managing knowledge workers falls under the purview of human resources, and only effective human resources tools, plans, and procedures can ensure the success of this task. One such tool, which has the capacity and capability to change the whole scenario in an organization's favor, is the human resource information system (HRIS). The purpose of this structured review is to provide insight into a field of HRM (i.e., HRIS) that has largely been neglected by other reviews of the literature and has only been briefly discussed by a small number of publications published in reputable, top-tier journals. A customized HRIS framework is the result of this structured literature review for managing knowledge and competence.

It guarantees the access of members to external knowledge and overall supply chain improvement in competitive environment. The steel industry as the second âkeyâ and âstrategicâ industry after oil and petrochemical industry in Iran as one of the important countries in middle-east and due to its importance for development but also due to the characteristics of its cost accounting system is selected as case study. Regarding to, this study aimed to design a comprehensive list containing all knowledge sharing (KS) motivational factors for steel industries supply chain. Thus, a mixed method of qualitative (a three-phase Delphi method) and quantitative (decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory-DEMATEL) has been adopted. At first stage, the 33 motivational factors of KS were identified through literature review. Then using Delphi method, respondents were provided with the findings from the literature to shortlist and merge the factors based on steel industry supply chain features. Due to different theoretical and practical standpoints of views about KS motivators in steel industry supply chain, 30 respondents (experts) participated. The final factors extracted via Delphi method was 15. Then, DEMATEL method was used to find interdependence among factors. At the end, cost accounting system for each factor were asked from knowledge management departments in steel supply chain. The results indicated that majority of the costs in steel industry supply chain is spent in decreasing power and sense of ownership of knowledge, improving culture and expectations, and improving personal contact and interaction, team culture, rewards, strategic thinking, and individual management of time, respectively. Whereas, the results of DEMATEL technique indicated that team culture, power, and sense of ownership of knowledge; personal contact and interaction; trust; culture; and expectations are the 5th high ranking factors. Although there are plenty of techniques used for improving team culture such as community of practice, after action review, Knowledge cafâe, it is not so dominant in cost accounting system. Hopefully, departments consider power and sense of ownership of knowledge more carefully. Managers in steel supply chain pay more attention to cultural issues by having educational courses.

        This paper presents a framework of knowledge risk management in the face of the COVIDâ19 crisis, derived from the literature on knowledge management, knowledge security, and COVIDâ19. So far, both researchers and practitioners have focused on knowledge as an asset and their efforts have been aimed at the implementation of knowledge management in various organizational contexts. However, with increasing threats related to cyberattacks or hazards associated with knowledge loss (as magnified by the COVIDâ19 crisis), there is a growing need to account for knowledgeârelated risks. In this conceptual paper, we integrate the contributions from the knowledge management and knowledge security fields, together with research on COVIDâ19 to help organizations protect the knowledge they create, store and share. Based on a structured literature review, our investigation provides researchers and managers with a framework for securely handling organizational knowledge in a critical situation. Our framework revolves around two foci: one the one hand, building appropriate knowledge risk measures and controls; on the other hand, holistically tackling knowledge risks as part of knowledge management activities.",Study supported with the research grant received by Malgorzata Zieba from the National Science Centre (Poland) in the context of a research project âKnowledge risks in modern organizationsâ (No. 2019/33/B/HS4/02250).,,Knowledge and Process Management,,,2022-03-29,2022,2022-03-29,2022-04,29,2,121-131,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Zieba, Malgorzata; Bongiovanni, Ivano","Zieba, Malgorzata (Faculty of Management and Economics, Department of Management, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland); Bongiovanni, Ivano (School of Business, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia)","Zieba, Malgorzata (GdaÅsk University of Technology)","Zieba, Malgorzata (GdaÅsk University of Technology); Bongiovanni, Ivano (University of Queensland)",6,6,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/kpm.1707,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146678797,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

The knowledge management process (KMP) is also a key determinant of FI. Existing literature is limited to knowledge management (KM) and its impact on CSP. This study aims to determine the effect of the KMP (acquisition, dissemination, and application) on sustainable corporate performance with the association of FI. The survey method was used to collect data from 356 small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in China. Structure equation modeling was applied to obtain the results of collected data. Results show that all three dimensions of KM have a significant impact on CSP. Furthermore, FI also has a significant and positive impact on CSP. Results further show that FI partially mediates the relationship of the knowledge dissemination, knowledge application and sustainable corporate performance but no mediation role FI was found between knowledge acquisition and CSP. The findings of this study will provide useful insights for experts and manufacturers. It will help to understand the role of KM in their organizational behavior by being an economical manufacturing process. This study underscored the importance of the KMP to policymakers. In countries such as China that have global orders, KM is an essential determinant of FI. KM is a tool used to achieve CSP goals inside and outside of an enterprise, thus the development firms need to focus on KM.",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,2022-03-21,2022,2022-03-21,,13,,850820,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kun, Ma","Kun, Ma (Department of Philosophy, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China)","Kun, Ma (Nanjing University)","Kun, Ma (Nanjing University)",3,3,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.850820/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146494236,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

In this model, TMT knowledge hiding was the independent variable, TMT creativity was the mediating variable, enterprise innovation performance was the dependent variable, and team competitive climate was the moderating variable. MPLUS7.0 was used for the CFAs to evaluate the discriminate validities of the key variables, and SPSS 22.0 was used to calculate the descriptive statistics, analyze the correlations between variables, make the multiple regression analysis, and process the data obtained from 612 executives in 53 TMTs. The results showed that TMT knowledge hiding had a significant negative impact on enterprise innovation performance; TMT creativity had a partial mediating effect between TMT knowledge hiding and enterprise innovation performance, and team competitive climate had a moderating effect on the relationship between TMT knowledge hiding and TMT creativity.

The behavior of sharing knowledge is an essential activity for the prosperity of the organization. For individuals, however, sharing knowledge can present a dilemma by giving up the exclusive right to certain knowledge that they own. This study identifies the psychological well-being as a leading factor in facilitating knowledge-sharing in dilemma situations. The author classified knowledge management behavior into sharing, hiding, and manipulating behavior, and studied them as mediators linking psychological well-being and performance. And to check the influence of the quality of the exchange relationship, leader-member exchange was used as a moderator. For the empirical analysis, 333 members from 12 organizations were surveyed by using different sources and times. Hierarchical regression analysis and bootstrapping analysis were conducted for verification of hypothesis. Results demonstrated that the psychological well-being influence directly on knowledge-sharing, -hiding, and -manipulating behaviors and indirectly on performance. In the multi-mediation test, only knowledge-sharing behavior mediated the relationship between psychological well-being and performance. And the moderating effect of leader-member exchange was significant only in the relationship between psychological well-being and knowledge-sharing behavior.

This study aims to identify whether BD and KM can be established in these emerging issues. We used a survey questionnaire to collect data from various firms and industries. We used structural equation modeling (SmartPLS and SPSS) to validate the research model with a sample of 155 companies in a developing country such as Indonesia. The result demonstrates a positive relationship between KEEC and BPI, followed by several significant findings such as BDAT with KEEC; KEEC on big data knowledge management (BDKM); BDKM and BPI; and BDAT on BDKM. In contrast, BDAT is nonsignificant for direct relationship on BPI, and interestingly, it becomes a significant result after mediated by BDKM. Similarly, BDKM has successfully mediated the relationship between KEEC and BPI. The management level ideally develops and increases such a knowledge creation/acquisition practices and BDAT in an organization to gain more meaningful benefits from these two capabilities. BDAT, KEEC, and BDKM simultaneously are a clear antecedent approach, which ultimately results in flexibility, effectiveness, and effectivity of BPI.

As information professionals are often asked to contribute their knowledge to assist clinicians and researchers in selecting journals for publication, the authors recognized an opportunity to build a decision support tool, SPI-Hub: Scholarly Publishing Information Hubâ¢, to capture the team's collective publishing industry knowledge, while carefully retaining the quality of service.
CASE PRESENTATION: SPI-Hub's decision support functionality relies on a data framework that describes journal publication policies and practices through a newly designed metadata structure, the Knowledge Management Journal Recordâ¢. Metadata fields are populated through a semi-automated process that uses custom programming to access content from multiple sources. Each record includes 25 metadata fields representing best publishing practices. Currently, the database includes more than 24,000 health sciences journal records. To correctly capture the resources needed for both completion and future maintenance of the project, the team conducted an internal study to assess time requirements for completing records through different stages of automation.
CONCLUSIONS: The journal decision support tool, SPI-Hub, provides an opportunity to assess publication practices by compiling data from a variety of sources in a single location. Automated and semi-automated approaches have effectively reduced the time needed for data collection.

Additionally, this study has examined the mediating role of knowledge process capabilities in the relationship between organizational characteristics and entrepreneurial orientation among those employees and the moderating effect of psychological factors on the relationship between organizational characteristics and entrepreneurial orientation.
Design methodology and approach: The study has employed the survey-based methodology and data are collected with the aid of self-administered questionnaires. This study utilized the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to establish the validity and reliability of the measurement model and test the relationships. The response rate of the current study is 64.66%.
Findings: The study findings have shown mixed results as one of the organizational characteristics, namely, resource and time availability is an insignificant determinate of entrepreneurial orientation among the manufacturing industry employees in Punjab province of Pakistan. Whereas management support, rewards, work discretion, and knowledge process capabilities appear as significant determinates of employees' entrepreneurial orientation. The results indicated that knowledge process capabilities have a mediating role in the relationship between organizational characteristics and employees' entrepreneurial orientation. Moreover, psychological factors, namely, propensity to take risk and locus of control have a significant moderating role on the relationship of management support, rewards, and work discretion with employees' entrepreneurial orientation.
Practical implications: The empirical insights on the study are valuable for policymakers and managers in manufacturing sectors of developing countries, such as Pakistan, to enrich their work performance through the understanding impact of organizational characteristics and knowledge process capabilities on the entrepreneurial orientation with moderating role of psychological factors.
Originality and value: Studies on the mediating impact of knowledge process capabilities on the linkage between organizational characteristics and entrepreneurial orientation with the moderating role of psychological factors remain limited. This study is one of the earliest studies that investigate these inter-relationships.",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,2022-12-14,2022,2022-12-14,,13,,799149,All OA; Gold,Article,"Basheer, Muhammad Farhan; Sabir, Saeed Ahmad; Raoof, Rabeeya; Hameed, Waseem Ul; Jabeen, Saida","Basheer, Muhammad Farhan (Lahore Business School, The University of Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan); Sabir, Saeed Ahmad (Hailey College of Commerce, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan); Raoof, Rabeeya (Lahore Business School, The University of Lahore, Lahore, Pakistan); Hameed, Waseem Ul (Institute of Business, Management and Administrative Sciences, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, Bahawalpur, Pakistan); Jabeen, Saida (Lahore Business School, The University of Lahore, Islamabad, Pakistan)","Sabir, Saeed Ahmad (University of the Punjab)","Basheer, Muhammad Farhan (University of Lahore); Sabir, Saeed Ahmad (University of the Punjab); Raoof, Rabeeya (University of Lahore); Hameed, Waseem Ul (Islamia University of Bahawalpur); Jabeen, Saida (University of Lahore)",0,0,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.799149/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153620214,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

However, little research has empirically explored how entrepreneurial leadership (EL) influences entrepreneurial success (ES). Moreover, the role of knowledge management processes (KMPs) and knowledge entrepreneurship (KE) have been overlooked. Thus, using a knowledge-based view theory, this study aims to determine the relationship between EL and ES, mediated through KMPs. In addition, for a better understanding, the study also used KE as a moderator. A quantitative survey method has been employed to collect data from 390 entrepreneurial venture (EV) owners, co-founders, and managers in tech-oriented ventures (IT and Software-based) operating in Pakistan. Smart partial least squares (PLS) statistical software was used to analyze the impact mechanism of EL on ES through the structural equation model. The findings revealed that EL style positively influences ES. In addition, KMPs fully mediate the relationship between EL and ES. Furthermore, KE as a moderator, strengthens the relationships between EL and the knowledge management process.

In addition, we examine the mediating role of self-directed learning (SDL) and knowledge management processes (KMPs) on the relationship between EI and learning outcomes.
METHODS: The sample, for this study, consisted of 547 academic and administrative personnel at Chinese higher educational institutions (HEIs), and the hypothesized associations were examined through partial least squares structural equation modeling.
RESULTS: Our results indicated that EI has no significant influence on learning outcomes. However, an indirect relationship between EI and learning outcomes is established through SDL and KMPs.
CONCLUSIONS: This study strengthens the professional understanding of EI and supports that the personnel at HEIs should value SDL and KMPs, which in turn enhances their learning outcomes. Although EI has received increased importance in higher education institutions, there are few studies that have investigated the relationship of EI, SDL, KMP, and learning outcomes. This is one of the initial studies that has empirically examined the interface of EI and learning outcomes in HEIs and also provides timely insights into the understanding of the mediating role of SDL and KMP.","Funding: The project was funded under the program of the Minister of Science and Higher Education titled âRegional Initiative of Excellenceâ in 2019â2022, project number 018/RID/2018/19, the amount of funding PLN 10 788 423,16.",,PLOS ONE,,"China; Emotional Intelligence; Humans; Knowledge Management; Learning; Least-Squares Analysis; Models, Theoretical; Self Concept; Universities",2021-07-27,2021,2021-07-27,,16,7,e0255177,All OA; Gold,Article,"Shafait, Zahid; Khan, Muhammad Asif; Bilan, Yuriy; OlÃ¡h, Judit","Shafait, Zahid (School of Management, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xiâan, Shaanxi, China); Khan, Muhammad Asif (Faculty of Management Sciences, University of Kotli, Kotli, AJK, Pakistan); Bilan, Yuriy (Center for Applied Economic Research, Faculty of Management and Economics, Tomas Bata University in ZlÃ­n, ZlÃ­n, Czech Republic); OlÃ¡h, Judit (Department of Management, Faculty of Applied Sciences, WSB University, Dabrowa GÃ³rnicza, Poland)","OlÃ¡h, Judit (University of DÄbrowa GÃ³rnicza)","Shafait, Zahid (Northwestern Polytechnical University); Khan, Muhammad Asif (); Bilan, Yuriy (Tomas Bata University in ZlÃ­n); OlÃ¡h, Judit (University of DÄbrowa GÃ³rnicza)",17,17,4.28,26.95,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0255177&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139979028,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

In order to shed some light on this area we define three goals. Firstly, we investigate to what extent the different activities of clients on social media (SM), are important to the processes of knowledge management (KM) in companies. Secondly, we examine to what extent KM functions can be relevant in attaining the quality of IT services. Thirdly, we analyze to what extent KM mediates between SM and the quality of IT services, that is, which client activities on SM should be formalised in the form of KM processes so as to influence the quality of IT services. In order to asses these goals, the decision tree method was used at the sample of B2B companies, more specifically at the sample of those companies offering Knowledge Intensive Business Services (KIBS). The study has shown that: (i) SM client activities have the largest importance for building efficient KM; (ii) KM functions are relevante to the overall quality of IT services, and (iii) those SM options and activities have been identified, whose importance for the assessment of the quality of IT services is indirectly transmitted through KM. This paper offers new empirical evidence which can lead to a better understanding of the role of KM in KIBS. Thanks to the obtained findings, managers will be able to define the goals of their companies in relation to the utilization of SM, more specifically: their presentation on SM, monitoring the outcomes of the SM, usage improving their KM practices and, thus, define strategies to increase the quality of the IT services they offer.",The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Commerce; Decision Trees; Humans; Knowledge Management; Social Media,2020-08-03,2020,2020-08-03,,15,8,e0236735,All OA; Gold,Article,"KaÅ¡Äelan, Ljiljana; Bach, Mirjana PejiÄ; RondoviÄ, Biljana; ÄuriÄkoviÄ, Tamara","KaÅ¡Äelan, Ljiljana (Faculty of Economics, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro); Bach, Mirjana PejiÄ (Faculty of Economics & Business, Zagreb, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia); RondoviÄ, Biljana (Faculty of Economics, University of Montenegro, Podgorica, Montenegro); ÄuriÄkoviÄ, Tamara (Agency for Control and Quality Assurance of Higher Education, Podgorica, Montenegro)","ÄuriÄkoviÄ, Tamara ","KaÅ¡Äelan, Ljiljana (University of Montenegro); Bach, Mirjana PejiÄ (University of Zagreb); RondoviÄ, Biljana (University of Montenegro); ÄuriÄkoviÄ, Tamara ()",5,4,,2.72,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0236735&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129843738,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems",

                  Research in the nursing home industry shows more robust knowledge management activities are associated with the adoption of patient-centered, culture change initiatives among high Medicaid nursing homes. These findings are notable because they highlight the important role that knowledge management activities may play for improving quality of care in under-resourced nursing homes. They also raise important questions about the conditions that may support or hinder the use of these activities. Using survey responses from 393 nursing home administrators, we empirically examined whether two components of human resources â staffing levels and HRM practices â are associated with the level of knowledge management activities in high Medicaid census nursing homes. More robust HRM practices were associated with greater levels of knowledge management activities, as well as three separate domains of knowledge management (acquisition, dissemination, and responsiveness). Staffing levels, in contrast, were not significantly associated with the level of knowledge management activities.",,,Innovation in Aging,,,2020-12-16,2020,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,4,Suppl 1,679-680,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hearld, Larry; Ghiasi, Akbar; Davlyatov, Ganisher; Weech-Maldonado, Robert","Hearld, Larry (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States); Ghiasi, Akbar (University of Incarnate Word, San Antonio, Texas, United States); Davlyatov, Ganisher (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States); Weech-Maldonado, Robert (UAB, Birmingham, Alabama, United States)",,"Hearld, Larry (University of Alabama at Birmingham); Ghiasi, Akbar (University of the Incarnate Word); Davlyatov, Ganisher (University of Alabama at Birmingham); Weech-Maldonado, Robert (University of Alabama at Birmingham)",0,0,,0.0,https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/4/Supplement_1/679/34919413/igaa057.2364.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133655392,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of knowledge management capabilities (KMC) in new product development performance with the mediating role of organizational agility. Additionally, this study also intends to examine the moderating role of business model innovation on the relationship of KMC with organizational agility. This study was conducted on the Chinese automobile sector, and the NPD project managers, supervisors, and engineers of the sector were respondents of this study. A survey questionnaire was used to collect the data from 201 respondents, and data were analyzed using the Smart PLS 3 software. The findings of this research, although limited to the automobile industries, indicate that knowledge sharing and knowledge application have significant and positive effects on the development of new products. Organizational agility significantly mediates the relationship of KMC with NPD. The results found that business model innovation has a significant moderating role in the relationship between KMC and organizational agility. Moreover, the results of this study will assist the managers in developing a modern competitive business environment by implicating KMC in the process of NPD. Lastly, organizations may improve the sustainability of their product and their overall performance by using organizational agility and modern ways of value delivery.",,This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (72171197).,Frontiers in Psychology,,,2022-07-28,2022,2022-07-28,,13,,950054,All OA; Gold,Article,"Idrees, Hisham; Hynek, Josef; Xu, Jin; Akbar, Ahsan; Jabeen, Samrena","Idrees, Hisham (School of Economics and Management, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China); Hynek, Josef (Department of Informatics and Quantitative Methods, Faculty of Informatics and Management, University of Hradec Kralove, Hradec KrÃ¡lovÃ©, Czechia); Xu, Jin (School of Economics and Management, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China); Akbar, Ahsan (International Business School, Guangzhou City University of Technology, Guangzhou, China); Jabeen, Samrena (Faculty of Business Management, University of Bahrain, Zallaq, Bahrain)","Idrees, Hisham (Southwest Jiaotong University); Akbar, Ahsan ","Idrees, Hisham (Southwest Jiaotong University); Hynek, Josef (University of Hradec KrÃ¡lovÃ©); Xu, Jin (Southwest Jiaotong University); Akbar, Ahsan (); Jabeen, Samrena (University of Bahrain)",6,6,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.950054/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149814832,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

This can be achieved through evidence-based practice (EBP), defined as the use of evidence from research, context, patient preferences, and clinical expertise. However, the contemporary and process-integrated supply of evidence-based knowledge at the point of care is a major challenge. An integrative knowledge management system supporting practicing clinical nurses in their daily work providing evidence-based knowledge at the point of care is required. The aim of this study was (1) to map standardized and structured nursing interventions classification and evidence on a knowledge platform to support evidence-based knowledge at the point of care, and (2) to explore the challenge of achieving interoperability between the source terminology of the nursing interventions classification (LEP Nursing 3) and the target format of the evidence provided on the knowledge platform (FIT-Nursing Care).MethodsIn an iterative three-round mapping process, three raters, nurses with clinical and nursing informatics or EBP experience, matched nursing interventions from the LEP Nursing 3 classification and evidence provided from Cochrane Reviews summarized on FIT-Nursing Care as so-called study synopses. We used a logical mapping method. We analysed the feasibility using thematic analysis.ResultsIn the third and final mapping round, a total of 47.01% (252 of 536) of nursing interventions from LEP Nursing 3 were mapped to 92.31% (300 of 325) of synopses from FIT-Nursing Care. The interrater reliability of 77.52% suggests good agreement. The experience from the whole mapping process provides important findings: (1) different content orientationsâbecause both systems pursue different purposes (content validity), (2) content granularityâdifferences regarding the structure and the level of detail in both systems, and (3) operationalization of knowledge.ConclusionMapping of research evidence to nursing classification seems feasible; however, three specific challenges were identified: different content orientation; content granularity; and operationalization of knowledge.

Based on the ICT-enabled capabilities perspective, this study explores the direct and indirect effects between lower- and higher-order capabilities, such as ICT, knowledge management capability (KM) and product innovation flexibility (PIF), on the performance of Ibero-American small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This paper uses second-order structural equation models to test the research hypotheses with a sample of 130 Ibero-American SMEs. The results contribute to filling the gap in the SME-focused literature on empirical studies examining ICT-enabled capabilities and firm performance. The results show an enabling effect of ICT on higher-order capabilities, such as KM and PIF, which, by acting as mediating variables, create value and improve performance through innovation in firms.",We thank the Research Department of the Universidad CatÃ³lica de la SantÃ­sima ConcepciÃ³n for facilitating this research through funding from project DIREG 11/2020.

They face different challenges in the implementation of knowledge management processes, including the transformation of tacit knowledge-experience, skills, insights, intuition, judgment and know-how-into explicit knowledge. Furthermore, the increasing number of information sources and services in some domains, such as healthcare, increase the amount of information available. Therefore, there is a need to transform that information in knowledge. In this context, learning ecosystems emerge as solutions to support knowledge management in a different context. On the other hand, the dashboards enable the generation of knowledge through the exploitation of the data provided from different sources. The model-driven development of these solutions is possible through two meta-models developed in previous works. Even though those meta-models solve several problems, the learning ecosystem meta-model has a lack of decision-making support. In this context, this work provides two main contributions to face this issue. First, the definition of a holistic meta-model to support decision-making processes in ecosystems focused on knowledge management, also called learning ecosystems. The second contribution of this work is an instantiation of the presented holistic meta-model in the healthcare domain.",The authors would like to thank the InterAction and eLearning Research Group (GRIAL) for its support to conduct the present research https://grial.usal.es.,"This research was partially funded by the Spanish Government Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness throughout the DEFINES project grant number [TIN2016-80172-R].

Given the critical importance of green technology implementation (GTI) is important for production process improvement and an eco-friendly environment. The present study investigates the connection between GTI and the knowledge management (KM) process to minimize manufacturing risk. This research also validates that an assured combination of green implementation and KM can lead to minimizing manufacturing risk. The sample data (153) was taken from those manufacturing companies that utilize green technologies. Smart PLS 3.2.9 analyzes the relationship between certain variables of GTI and the KM process. Furthermore, fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is used for a combined configurational approach to examine manufacturing risk minimization. The studyâs outcome validated that green implementation positively correlated with KM to minimize production risk. fsQCA approach, KM, and green implementation outcome indicated that production risks are minimized. This study contributes to bridging research gaps in the literature and advances understanding of the interrelationship between green implementation and KM processes to minimize manufacturing risk. In addition, research is vital to combine direct and configurational methodologies to highlight two distinct facets of green implementation and the KM process for minimizing manufacturing risk.",This research was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (no. 19BTQ035).,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,Knowledge Management; Technology; Commerce,2023-02-23,2023,2023-02-23,2023-04,30,18,51977-51994,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Alam, Sajjad; Zhang, Jianhua; Khan, Naveed; Ali, Ahmad","Alam, Sajjad (School of Management, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Zhang, Jianhua (School of Management, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China); Khan, Naveed (School of Business Administration, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea); Ali, Ahmad (School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China)","Alam, Sajjad (Zhengzhou University)","Alam, Sajjad (Zhengzhou University); Zhang, Jianhua (Zhengzhou University); Khan, Naveed (Hanyang University); Ali, Ahmad (Hebei University of Technology)",2,2,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11356-023-25945-2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155674383,40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Findings: In these studies, knowledge management in sport mega-events was mainly researched in the context of the Olympic Games. Compared with other events, the Olympic Games built a more formal knowledge management programme, which may explain why it attracted more attention.
Discussion: Most of the studies highlighted the importance of tacit knowledge and individuals, as well as the needs of different stakeholder groups. Findings showed that social, cultural, political, and historical differences between hosts weaken the effect of knowledge management.

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is the country's public health institute with the mandate to protect the health of Nigerians. Achieving such mandate in resource-limited settings with divergent demographic characteristics of the citizens, necessitates the readiness to learn from experience and to develop policies and activities in line with lessons learnt and best practices. This practice paper describes the initiatives of the NCDC towards adapting its public health response activities by establishing learning systems across its structure. The paper informs on some of the steps taken by the Centre regarding learning from the Lassa fever outbreak and the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.

This study aims to explore the mediating role of digital capability between knowledge heterogeneity and team performance and the moderating role of knowledge conversion. This study is quantitative and horizontal, focusing on digital project teams in China. The findings indicate that team knowledge heterogeneity can predict team performance, in which team digital capability plays a mediating role. Internal knowledge conversion enhances the positive relationship between team knowledge heterogeneity and capability, and further, external knowledge conversion enhances the moderating role of internal knowledge conversion. The originality of this study is that, concerning the relationship between knowledge heterogeneity and team performance, it is the first time to develop a model that regards digital capability as a mediator and knowledge conversion as a moderator. We constitute a significant contribution to the literature. Additionally, this study contains a series of practical implications which may contribute teams to a competitive advantage in emerging markets.","The authors would like to thank the editors and reviewers for their valuable contributions to the improvement of the study.

One of the priority aspects for the program to run well and smoothly is the role of institutions in knowledge management and process sharing. This paper examines the role of knowledge management and sharing in cooperatives with qualitative limitations at the knowledge process level, knowledge design level, strategic interaction level, social participation level, academic and scientific ecosystem level, and network and partnership level. A qualitative description becomes a research method with secondary data in the form of a comparison of cooperatives in 2019-2021 as a representation before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 secondary data for 20 months from April 2020 to September 2022 in Indonesia dynamically also support sharpening the analysis. The source of cooperative data is from the publications of the Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs, while the source of COVID-19 data comes from the publication of the COVID-19 Task Force. The analysis is carried out by building qualitative aspects into quantitative ones that can be formulated in the form of cooperative applications. The result is that the application of the knowledge process level, knowledge design level, strategic interaction level, social participation level, academic and scientific ecosystem level, and network and partnership level can improve decision-making, capture, share, and measure institutional knowledge for the success of the NER Program.",,,Frontiers in Public Health,,Humans; COVID-19; Knowledge Management; Pandemics; Ecosystem; Indonesia,2022-12-06,2022,2022-12-06,,10,,963755,All OA; Gold,Article,"Khasanah, Nur; Sriyana, Jaka; Prasetyo, Andjar; Nurdinawati, Vita; Hartopo, Agustinus; Wahyudianto, Heri; Gartika, Dewi; Fahlevi, Mochammad","Khasanah, Nur (Doctoral Program in Economics, Universitas Islam Indonesia, Yogyakarta, Indonesia); Sriyana, Jaka (Department of Economics, Universitas Islam Indonesia, Yogyakarta, Indonesia); Prasetyo, Andjar (Regional Development Planning Agency, Magelang, Central Java, Indonesia); Nurdinawati, Vita (Jurusan Teknik Elektromedik, Poltekkes Kemenkes Jakarta II, Jakarta, Indonesia); Hartopo, Agustinus (Regional Development Planning Agency of Papua Province, Jayapura, Indonesia); Wahyudianto, Heri (Regional Development Planning Agency of Papua Province, Jayapura, Indonesia); Gartika, Dewi (Research and Development Agency of West Java Province, Bandung, Indonesia); Fahlevi, Mochammad (Management Department, BINUS Online Learning, Bina Nusantara University, Jakarta, Indonesia)","Prasetyo, Andjar ","Khasanah, Nur (Islamic University of Indonesia); Sriyana, Jaka (Islamic University of Indonesia); Prasetyo, Andjar (); Nurdinawati, Vita (); Hartopo, Agustinus (); Wahyudianto, Heri (); Gartika, Dewi (); Fahlevi, Mochammad (Binus University)",0,0,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.963755/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153404463,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,

However, communication gaps impede the implementation of person-centered care in favor of routinized care.
OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether self-organizing knowledge management reduces communication gaps and improves the quality of person-centered dementia care.
METHOD: We implemented a self-organizing knowledge management system. Eight significant others of residents with severe dementia and six professional caregivers used a mobile application for six months. We conducted qualitative interviews and focus groups afterward.
MAIN FINDINGS: Participants reported that the system increased the quality of person-centered care, reduced communication gaps, increased the task satisfaction of caregivers and the wellbeing of significant others.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on our findings, we develop the following hypotheses: self-organizing knowledge management might provide a promising tool to improve the quality of person-centered care. It might reduce communication barriers that impede person-centered care. It might allow transferring content-maintaining tasks from caregivers to significant others. Such distribution of tasks, in turn, might be beneficial for both parties.

                  Nursing home quality has been a matter of long-standing policy interest at the federal and state level, as it concerns the health and well-being of one of our most vulnerable populations. Mor et al. (2004) described the nursing home industry as a âtwo-tieredâ system, with the lower-tier nursing homes operating in a resource-constrained environment given their high proportion of Medicaid residents (85% or higher). Medicaid is the largest payer of nursing homes but its reimbursement rates typically lag Medicare as well as private pay. Lower tier facilities are characterized by lower professional staffing and occupancy rates, and worse quality. Such facilities have a higher proportion of minority residents and are generally located in communities with significant proportions of poor and minority residents, exacerbating the existing disparities in nursing home care. However, there are performance variations among high Medicaid nursing homes, with some facilities performing significantly better than others on both quality and financial performance. What may explain the superior performance of certain nursing homes that are operating in a similarly resource-constrained environment? Factors, such as management resources and environmental resource availability, may be the critically important differentiators. The purpose of this symposium is to examine the organizational/management and community factors that may be associated with high-performance among a similar group of resource-constrained nursing homes. Using survey, secondary, and qualitative data analysis, this symposium will explore the role that culture change, leadership style, human resource management practices, knowledge management, and community factors can have on nursing home performance.",,,Innovation in Aging,,,2020-12-16,2020,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,4,Suppl 1,679-679,All OA; Gold,Article,"Weech-Maldonado, Robert","Weech-Maldonado, Robert ()",,"Weech-Maldonado, Robert ()",0,0,,0.0,https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/4/Supplement_1/679/34918826/igaa057.2361.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133655389,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Teamwork in NH is essential for effective delivery of the highest quality of services. As a result, NH are increasingly adopting KM activities to enable knowledge creation, storage, transfer, and implementation in an environment facing many challenges such as lack of staff, increasing demands, and expectations of residents.
Methods: In our quantitative study, we examined how two Slovenian state NH that adopted the E-Qalin quality management model (European quality-improving learning model) adapted their KM, and what impact their quality management system and KM activities actually have on the quality of services. Furthermore, we examined how two Slovenian private NH that have not adopted a certified quality management program (like ISO or E-Qalin) tackle the issue of quality of services from the KM perspective. The sample consisted of 80 nursing professionals. In every NH that is part of this study, teamwork is essential and every individual that was involved in our survey is part of a team. In our study, we analyzed relationships between individual variables using linear regression.
Results: We found a significant and positive relationship between knowledge creation, transfer, and implementation in NH with and without the E-Qalin certificate. We found a significant and positive relationship between knowledge storage and the quality of services only in NH without a E-Qualin certificate. It seems that when connecting multidisciplinary fields such as NH and KM, there is still a lack of awareness and knowledge on the topic of KM, which might be one of the reasons for some bias in the answers provided by respondents. We also found different teamwork approaches in NH with and without a E-Qalin certificate. Our research results therefore emphasize the need to gain additional insight into quality management and KM in the environment of NH.
Conclusion: Teamwork based on knowledge storage, transfer, the implementation of existing knowledge, and creation of new knowledge are essential for well-trained professionals and, as a result, contribute to continuous improvement in service quality. Implementation of KM is well received by NH, and enables them to better meet the needs and expectations of residents. More importantly, nursing staff also share and pass on tacit knowledge through teamwork. Finally, all of the NH in our study that implemented quality and KM activities noted an improvement in the quality of services that are offered to residents in practice. Our results indicate that the topic of KM in NH is interesting, and it has a positive impact on the quality of services in practice. However, the problem of awareness and knowledge on the topic of KM in the environment of NH still exists, highlighting the need for further research, additional insight, and dissemination of knowledge to every interested stakeholder functioning in the field of NH. The results of the study make an important contribution to the research of KM in NH, focusing on the transfer of tacit knowledge.",The authors would like to thank the caregivers and management of the care homes for their participation in the study and Robert McKenzie for his language editing efforts.,"VD and SC acknowledge the funding by the Slovenian Research Agency programme SEB ULP5-0364 (A).

        COVIDâ19 pandemic unleashed uncertainties around the world. Organizations scrambled to ensure business continuity. COVIDâ19 pandemic was unprecedented as disruptions were far beyond business continuity scenarios planning with respect to severities, timelines, and geographies. Initially, business disruptions were assumed to last just for a few days or weeks at a local governing region, county, or state level. However, the pandemic lasted much longer and sustained efforts were needed to stay compliant with everâevolving and changing local, state, federal, and international guidelines, rules, and regulations. Prolonged work from home became an unavoidable and only way to ensure business continuity for many serviceâoriented organizations. Organizations not only tried to leverage existing knowledge management (KM) practices but also were compelled to critically relook at the efficacy and effectiveness of KM practices. Organizational KM systems and practices (OKMSP) in a typical Indian engineering consulting and design organization were studied. The changes in employee perceptions about OKMSP during the pandemic period were captured and critically analyzed. The study evaluated employee perceptions related to four critical aspects of OKMSP namely, KM processes, usage of KM tools, KM effectiveness, and KM culture. Lack of faceâtoâface meetings during the COVIDâ19 period made an important change in the way of working. This paper captures COVIDâ19 pandemicâinduced changes and provides pointers to further research opportunities in the field of OKMSP. The study highlights the need for robust knowledge management systems to face pandemicâinduced disruptions.",,,Knowledge and Process Management,,,2022-03-28,2022,2022-03-28,,,,,Closed,Article,"Apte, Shantanu; Lele, Abhijeet; Choudhari, Atul","Apte, Shantanu (Symbiosis International University (Deemed University) (SIU), Pune, India); Lele, Abhijeet (Symbiosis International University (Deemed University) (SIU), Pune, India; Symbiosis Institute of Business Management (SIBM), Pune, India); Choudhari, Atul (Tata Consulting Engineers Limited (TCE), Airoli, India)","Apte, Shantanu (Symbiosis International University)","Apte, Shantanu (Symbiosis International University); Lele, Abhijeet (Symbiosis International University; Symbiosis International University); Choudhari, Atul (Tata Sons (India))",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146675354,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

A published investigation report on an illicit manufacturing case was closely examined by organizing the available facts using the diagram. Based on 395 responses to the questionnaire survey, we found that although pharmaceutical companies understand the importance of knowledge management and quality culture, issues exist in their operational methods. A total of 94% of the respondents agreed that they mentioned â³knowledge managementâ³ as an enabler of the Pharmaceutical Quality System of ICH Q10, and 98% of the respondents accepted that insufficient fostering of quality culture leads to corporate risk. However, the survey revealed that many companies are struggling with this approach. Based on a report on an illicit manufacturing case, we analyzed the direct causes of misconduct and prepared a systematic summary that can be easily comprehended. Comparison of the illicit manufacturing case report with our questionnaire results suggests that many pharmaceutical companies do not regard the misconduct case as a situation that could occur in their company. With the revision of the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act and good manufacturing practice Ministerial Ordinance, we advocate the need for all employees of pharmaceutical companies to reconsider the priorities of their companies from the patient perspective.",,,PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology,,,2023-06-15,2023,2023-06-15,2023-06-15,,,pdajpst.2022.012797,Closed,Article,"Takahashi, Shiho; Takarada, Tetsuhito; Ito, Kanako; Shikano, Mayumi; Sakurai, Shingou","Takahashi, Shiho (Tokyo University of Science 3b21705@ed.tus.ac.jp.); Takarada, Tetsuhito (Tokyo University of Science.); Ito, Kanako (Tokyo University of Science.); Shikano, Mayumi (Tokyo University of Science.); Sakurai, Shingou (Tokyo University of Science.)",,"Takahashi, Shiho (Tokyo University of Science); Takarada, Tetsuhito (Tokyo University of Science); Ito, Kanako (Tokyo University of Science); Shikano, Mayumi (Tokyo University of Science); Sakurai, Shingou (Tokyo University of Science)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159860175,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,

This study also investigates the mediation of self-directed learning (personal autonomy, personal responsibility, and personal growth) and knowledge management processes (KMPs) concerning the relationship between EI and learning outcomes. Moreover, this study explores the relationship between learning outcomes and creative performance (creative self-efficacy and leadership/supervisor support). The survey method was considered appropriate for the data collection and was completed simultaneously through paper and electronic mediums. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) method with a measurement assessment, structural assessment, mediation, and multi-group analysis was applied to a sample of 729 academics and administrative staff from Chinese and Pakistani research universities. A few dissimilarities surfaced with regard to EI and learning outcomes while evaluating the higher education institutions (HEIs) from both countries. Moreover, an indirect relation between EI and learning outcomes was established via self-directed learning and KMPs. Lastly, the intended direct statistical association between learning outcomes and creative performance was also documented. This study may serve as an initiative to equate and differentiate EI in relation to learning outcomes and creative performance among higher education professionals in China and Pakistan. The considered framework is novel and supports both EI and learning outcomes while adhering to the perceived value of the two adjacent regions.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Humans; Emotional Intelligence; Universities; Surveys and Questionnaires; China; Learning,2022-12-04,2022,2022-12-04,,19,23,16215,All OA; Gold,Article,"Shafait, Zahid; Huang, Jiayu","Shafait, Zahid (College of Teacher Education, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua 321004, China.); Huang, Jiayu (National Governance Research Institute, School of Marxism, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua 321004, China.)","Shafait, Zahid (Zhejiang Normal University); Huang, Jiayu (Zhejiang Normal University)","Shafait, Zahid (Zhejiang Normal University); Huang, Jiayu (Zhejiang Normal University)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/23/16215/pdf?version=1670395329,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153392937,"39 Education; 3902 Education Policy, Sociology and Philosophy; 3903 Education Systems",4 Quality Education

                  This study examined the association between leadership styles (autocrat, consultative autocrat, consensus manager, and shareholder manager) and resident quality and financial performance in under-resourced nursing homes. Survey data from 391 Directors of Nursing were merged with secondary data from LTCFocus, Area Health Resource File, Medicare Cost Reports, and Nursing Home Compare. Two multivariate regressions were used to model the relationship between leadership styles and the dependent variables: nursing home star ratings (1-5) and operating margin. The independent variables were composite scores for leadership styles, while control variables included organizational and county-level factors. Results show that compared to autocratic leadership, the consultative autocrat (solicits feedback but has total authority) was associated with lower quality (p < 0.05), while the consensus manager (delegates authority to the group) was associated with lower profit margin (p < 0.05).

As tourism is one of the biggest employers and sectors of economic development, environmental knowledge in hospitality represents a worldwide challenge. The present study aims to provide a clear understanding of the impacts and implications of environmental knowledge in the hospitality industry in a COVID society, taking into account its general areas of evolution through a systematic review methodology using a bibliographic database over time (26Â years). We reviewed 944 documents collected from the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection database and analysed them using the Science Mapping Analysis Software Tool (SciMAT). In a world in which the environment is more deteriorated, it is important to be aware of the advance in environmental knowledge to take care of it and eliminate environmental degradation. This study adds value to the orchestration of knowledge by focusing on predictors that impact environmental knowledge. The results identify the development status and leading trends in environmental knowledge research to fall in love with the future in a COVID society. Falling in love with the future is possible in the hospitality industry.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the Ministerio de EconomÃ­a, Industria y Competitividad of the Spanish Government for financing the research project ECO2017-88987-R (MINECO/FEDER;UE), cofinanced from the European Union FEDER funds.",Open Access funding provided thanks to the CRUE-CSIC agreement with Springer Nature.,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,,,2022-01-26,2022,2022-01-26,,,,1-28,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"MartÃ­nez-MartÃ­nez, Aurora; Cegarra-Navarro, Juan-Gabriel; Cobo, Manuel-JesÃºs; de Valon, Tiphaine","MartÃ­nez-MartÃ­nez, Aurora (Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain); Cegarra-Navarro, Juan-Gabriel (Universidad PolitÃ©cnica de Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain); Cobo, Manuel-JesÃºs (Universidad CÃ¡diz, CÃ¡diz, Spain); de Valon, Tiphaine (Coventry University, Coventry, UK)","MartÃ­nez-MartÃ­nez, Aurora (Polytechnic University of Cartagena)","MartÃ­nez-MartÃ­nez, Aurora (Polytechnic University of Cartagena); Cegarra-Navarro, Juan-Gabriel (Polytechnic University of Cartagena); Cobo, Manuel-JesÃºs (University of CÃ¡diz); de Valon, Tiphaine (Coventry University)",5,5,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13132-022-00910-5.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145011400,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3803 Economic Theory,

The establishment of regional higher education Centres of Excellence (CoE) across Africa through a World Bank support aims to stimulate the needed transformation in education and research. However, excellence is a vague, and often indiscriminately used concept in academic circles. More importantly, the manner in which aspiring institutions can achieve academic excellence is described inadequately. The main objective of this paper is to describe the core processes of excellence as a prerequisite to establishing academic CoE in Africa.MethodsThe paper relies on our collaborative discussions and real-world insight into the pursuit of academic excellence, a narrative review using Pubmed search for a contextual understanding of CoEs in Africa supplemented by a Google search for definitions of CoEs in academic contexts.ResultsWe identified three key, synergistic processes of excellence central to institutionalizing academic CoEs: participatory leadership, knowledge management, and inter-disciplinary collaboration. (1) Participatory leadership encourages innovations to originate from the different parts of the organization, and facilitates ownership as well as a culture of excellence. (2) Centers of Excellence are future-oriented in that they are constantly seeking to achieve best practices, informed by the most up-to-date and cutting-edge research and information available. As such, the process by which centres facilitate the flow of knowledge within and outside the organization, or knowledge management, is critical to their success. (3) Such centres also rely on expertise from different disciplines and âengagedâ scholarship. This multidisciplinarity leads to improved research productivity and enhances the production of problem-solving innovations.ConclusionParticipatory leadership, knowledge management, and inter-disciplinary collaborations are prerequisites to establishing academic CoEs in Africa. Future studies need to extend our findings to understand the processes key to productivity, competitiveness, institutionalization, and sustainability of academic CoEs in Africa.",CDT-Africa is supported financially by the World Bank.,No funding for this study.,BMC Medical Education,,Africa; Fellowships and Scholarships; Humans; Leadership; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities,2021-01-07,2021,2021-01-07,2021-12,21,1,36,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fekadu, Abebaw; Oppenheim, Claire; Manyazewal, Tsegahun; Nislow, Corey; Woldeamanuel, Yimtubezinash; Hailu, Asrat; Belete, Anteneh; Wondimagegn, Dawit; Hanlon, Charlotte; Gebremariam, Tsige; Collins, Asha; Larson, Christopher J.; Gebreyes, Wondwossen; Aklilu, Eleni; Muula, Adamson S.; Mugus, Sabina; Caffrey, Conor R.; Giday, Mirutse; Yimer, Getnet; Davey, Gail; Medhin, Girmay; Makonnen, Eyasu","Fekadu, Abebaw (Center for Innovative Drug Development and Therapeutic Trials for Africa (CDT-Africa), College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Global Health & Infection Department, Brighton and Sussex Medical School, Brighton, UK); Oppenheim, Claire (Department of Psychiatry, Boston University, School of Medicine, Boston, USA); Manyazewal, Tsegahun (Center for Innovative Drug Development and Therapeutic Trials for Africa (CDT-Africa), College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia); Nislow, Corey (Center for Innovative Drug Development and Therapeutic Trials for Africa (CDT-Africa), College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada); Woldeamanuel, Yimtubezinash (Center for Innovative Drug Development and Therapeutic Trials for Africa (CDT-Africa), College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia); Hailu, Asrat (Center for Innovative Drug Development and Therapeutic Trials for Africa (CDT-Africa), College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia); Belete, Anteneh (Center for Innovative Drug Development and Therapeutic Trials for Africa (CDT-Africa), College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia); Wondimagegn, Dawit (College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia); Hanlon, Charlotte (Center for Innovative Drug Development and Therapeutic Trials for Africa (CDT-Africa), College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Kingâs College London, Centre for Global Mental Health, Health Services & Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London, UK); Gebremariam, Tsige (Department of Pharmaceutics and Social Pharmacy, College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia); Collins, Asha (Center for Innovative Drug Development and Therapeutic Trials for Africa (CDT-Africa), College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa University, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia); Larson, Christopher J.

Although most scholars have explored the mechanisms and paths of psychological capital on innovation performance, few scholars have explored the inner relationship between them from the perspective of knowledge management. Based on the knowledge management perspective, We explore the influence effect of the psychological capital of entrepreneurial teams on the innovation performance of startups in the entrepreneurial situation.
Methods: We conducted hypothesis testing using data from 113 Chinese entrepreneurial teams, and conducted reliability analysis, correlation analysis, and regression analysis on the questionnaire data with the help of SPSS software and AMOS software.
Results: The results showed that (1) entrepreneurial team psychological capital has a significant positive effect on innovation performance of startups; (2) entrepreneurial team psychological capital positively promotes their knowledge sharing behavior and reduces knowledge hiding behavior; (3) entrepreneurial team knowledge sharing and knowledge hiding play a partially mediating role between entrepreneurial team psychological capital and innovation performance of startups; (4)organizational innovation climate plays a moderating role in the influence of entrepreneurial team knowledge sharing and knowledge hiding on the innovation performance of startups.
Discussion: The findings are consistent with the hypothesis model proposed in this paper, indicating that as the psychological capital of entrepreneurial teams increases, the innovation performance of startups can benefit from higher levels of knowledge sharing and lower levels of knowledge hiding.",,"This study was supported by the following fund projects, namely Key Research Base of Philosophy and Social Sciences of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education (20JZ078), the Soft Science Project of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Science and Technology (2021KRM202), the Youth Fund for Humanities and Social Sciences of the Ministry of Education (18YJC630046), and the Key Think Tank Project of Shaanxi Provincial Department of Education (20JT057).",Frontiers in Psychology,,,2023-03-13,2023,2023-03-13,,14,,1133270,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chen, Minling; Mi, XueMei; Xue, Jing; Li, Yi; Shi, Junran","Chen, Minling (School of Economics and Management, Xiâan Shiyou University, Xiâan, China); Mi, XueMei (School of Economics and Management, Xiâan Shiyou University, Xiâan, China); Xue, Jing (School of Economics and Management, Xiâan Shiyou University, Xiâan, China); Li, Yi (School of Economics and Management, Xiâan Shiyou University, Xiâan, China); Shi, Junran (School of Finance and Public Administration, Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, Kunming, China)","Xue, Jing (Xi'an Shiyou University); Shi, Junran (Yunnan University of Finance And Economics)","Chen, Minling (Xi'an Shiyou University); Mi, XueMei (Xi'an Shiyou University); Xue, Jing (Xi'an Shiyou University); Li, Yi (Xi'an Shiyou University); Shi, Junran (Yunnan University of Finance And Economics)",0,0,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1133270/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156144503,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,

The need and potential of these systems within healthcare have been tremendously driven by the global instability that has affected several interrelated sectors. Accordingly, many research studies have reported on the inadequacies of these systems within the healthcare arena, which have distorted their potential and offerings to revolutionize healthcare. Thus, through a comprehensive review of the extant literature, this study presents a critique of the health information system for healthcare to supplement the gap created as a result of the lack of an in-depth outlook of the current health information system from a holistic slant. From the studies, the health information system was ascertained to be crucial and fundament in the drive of information and knowledge management for healthcare.

The field of cancer care is facing enormous challenges, requiring strong nursing leadership. Cancer nursing leadership is needed to overcome the challenges caused by workforce shortages, restricted resources, historic and ongoing under-recognition of nursing, unsafe working conditions, and unequal access to education. The aim of this article is to contribute to the discussion about how cancer nursing leaders can act as visionaries and support transformation of cancer nursing for the future.
DATA SOURCES: Author experience, journal articles and organizational position papers were used.
CONCLUSION: To improve the state of cancer nursing and the working conditions of the cancer nursing workforce, nursing leadership practices need to be embraced on all governance levels in clinical practice and academia. When effective and high-quality nursing leadership is enacted, positive outcomes for people affected by cancer, nursing, and health care systems can be achieved. Cancer nursing leadership needs to be supported through nursing scholarship, influencing national and global policies and strategies and by active involvement in national and international health care management.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nursing leadership and governance is critical to strengthening the cancer nursing workforce. Strong nursing leadership is required to realize the vision for transforming the health care systems and cancer care.

To alleviate this care burden, interventions have been proposed that use computer- or web-based applications. For example, an automatic diagnosis of the condition can improve the well-being of both the person with dementia and the caregiver. Other interventions support the individual with dementia in living independently.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop an ontology-based care knowledge management system for people with dementia that will provide caregivers with a care guide suited to the environment and to the individual patient's symptoms. This should also enable knowledge sharing among caregivers.
METHODS: To build the care knowledge model, we reviewed existing ontologies that contain concepts and knowledge descriptions relating to the care of those with dementia, and we considered dementia care manuals. The basic concepts of the care ontology were confirmed by experts in Korea. To infer the different care methods required for the individual dementia patient, the reasoning rules as defined in Semantic Web Rule Languages and Prolog were utilized. The accuracy of the care knowledge in the ontological model and the usability of the proposed system were evaluated by using the Pellet reasoner and OntOlogy Pitfall Scanner!, and a survey and interviews were conducted with caregivers working in care centers in Korea.
RESULTS: The care knowledge model contains six top-level concepts: care knowledge, task, assessment, person, environment, and medical knowledge. Based on this ontological model of dementia care, caregivers at a dementia care facility in Korea were able to access the care knowledge easily through a graphical user interface. The evaluation by the care experts showed that the system contained accurate care knowledge and a level of assessment comparable to normal assessment tools.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we developed a care knowledge system that can provide caregivers with care guides suited to individuals with dementia. We anticipate that the system could reduce the workload of caregivers.","We thank the caregivers working at the Seongbuk Welfare Center and the Gwangju Hanul Nursing Home for providing valuable feedback on the proposed system and helping us to improve it.

Behavioral Evidence From Africa, Asia, and the United States","OBJECTIVE: To contribute to strengthening family planning and reproductive health (FP/RH) programs by identifying behavioral factors that influence FP/RH professionals' knowledge management (KM) behaviors.
METHODS: We conducted an online survey, in-depth interviews, and cocreation workshops between July 2019 and June 2020 with a convenience sample of FP/RH professionals in Africa, Asia, and the United States to explore their KM behaviors. We used descriptive statistics to analyze the survey data and inductive thematic analysis for the interviews, and we synthesized participant inputs from selected cocreation activities.
RESULTS: The samples consisted of 273 survey respondents, 23 interviewees, and 69 cocreation workshop participants. There were no significant differences in how professionals seek and share information by gender, role, or geographic region, except related to language barriers among Francophone professionals. FP/RH professionals reported using both digital sources and their professional networks to seek and share information. Choice overload and cognitive overload (when people are presented with too much information and in a way that is hard to understand, respectively) act as barriers as they seek and use information. Too many information sources lead to frustration and inaction and best practices are often not contextualized or specific enough for application. Positive KM organizational cultures help facilitate effective information sharing, but reluctance to share information persists due to fear of losing comparative advantage. FP/RH professionals noted that such barriers result in duplication of effort and lack of advancement in FP/RH programs.
CONCLUSION: To improve overall program impact, KM interventions in FP/RH and global health should reduce cognitive and choice overload, especially by curating and sharing practical, actionable information with essential details on context and how programs are implemented so that others can apply or adapt the learnings. Programs should use incentives to foster motivation to share this type of information.","This article was based on formative research reports produced under the Knowledge SUCCESS project in 2020 including âFamily Planning Professionalsâ Behavioral Journey in Knowledge Management: Findings From Formative Researchâ and âThe Future of Knowledge Management for Family Planning and Reproductive Health Programs: Insights From Four Regional Co-Creation Workshops.â The authors would like to thank the individuals who completed the online survey and in-depth interviews and who participated in our regional cocreation workshops for their valuable insights about their knowledge management experiences in family planning and reproductive health and in global health more broadly.

Indeed, addressing societal concerns such as climate change and net zero means elements of contemporary practice in food supply chains need to be unlearned to ensure new practices are adopted. However, unlearning is a risky process if crucial knowledge is lost, for example, if knowledge is situated in the supply base not the organization itself, or there is insufficient organizational food safety knowledge generation, curation, and management when new practices/processes are designed and implemented. An exploratory, critical review of management and food safety academic and gray literature is undertaken that aims to consider the cycle of unlearning, learning, and relearning in food organizations and supply chains with particular emphasis on organizational innovation, inertia, and the impact on food safety management systems and food safety performance. Findings demonstrate it is critical with food safety practices, such as duration date coding or refrigeration practices, that organizations ""unlearn"" in a way that does not increase organizational, food safety, or public health risk. This paper contributes to extant literature by highlighting the organizational vulnerabilities that can arise when strategically unlearning to promote sustainability in a food supply context. Mitigating such organizational, food safety, and public health risk means organizations must simultaneously drive unlearning, learning, and relearning as a dynamic integrated knowledge acquisition and management approach.

        Effective management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVIDâ19) and the urgent need to improve epidemic prevention require rapid response and immediate solutions, deploying appropriate knowledge management procedures and facilitating effective decisionâmaking and managerial efforts. The increased adoption of smart cities (SC) technologies offers various technologies that can support knowledge capturing, acquisition, sharing, and transferring. However, knowledge management practitioners and decisionâmakers face various challenges to manage huge data generated from the various SC platforms. Managing COVIDâ19ârelated knowledge necessitates filtering, cleaning, keeping, and sharing only useful data. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate managing knowledge related to COVIDâ19 from a SC perspective. The methodological approach for this study is a systematic literature review. The findings indicate that SC technologies, through the advanced deployment of information communications technology (ICT) applications, have a crucial role in knowledge capturing and sharing. Smart cities strategies enable knowledge extraction through facilitating data collection and analysis over various disparate databases, as well as facilitating quick and accurate handling and analysis of huge and unpredicted amount of data. Managing knowledge related to COVIDâ19 pandemic has the potential to improve the planning, treatment and controlling the pandemic, enhance decisionâmaking, and enable disaster management. However, the managing of a huge amount of complex, unstructured data and information remains a big challenge for COVIDâ19 knowledge management (KM) initiatives. The paper proposes a conceptual model and illustrates the various components and links between SC strategies, KM and COVIDâ19, and how this can inform, facilitate, and enhance decisionâmaking to take steps for the path of recovery.","The authors would like to thank the review team for their encouragement and guidance throughout the review process.

ICH Q8 (Pharmaceutical Development), ICH Q11 (Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances), and ICH Q12 (Technical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmaceutical Product Lifecycle Management) each build on the expectation that knowledge will be managed effectively in order to support and improve the product and process across the pharmaceutical product life cycle. However, in spite of the fact that KM was introduced in ICH Q10 over 10âyears ago, there is ample evidence that it is not yet a mature discipline within the biopharmaceutical sector, and the authors suggest that this could hinder full realization of the potential benefits of ICH Q8, ICH Q11, and ICH Q12. The Pharmaceutical Regulatory Science Team (PRST), a research team based at the Dublin Technological University (TU Dublin) in Ireland, has been conducting research on KM for several years, and this paper presents the next phase in this research. Specifically, the focus of this current research was to explore ways to offer practical solutions to improve the management of knowledge across the pharmaceutical product life cycle, starting with a focus on enhancing knowledge transfer during technology transfer projects. The typical challenges associated with ineffective knowledge transfer were presented and the high-level requirements needed to address these were identified through the research. From these requirements, a four-step framework was developed as a systematic means to enhance knowledge transfer. Accompanying the framework was a KM toolkit consisting of a range of KM practices (tools, processes, and behaviors) to facilitate more effective knowledge flow during technology transfer. It was then illustrated how such a framework can be extended across the entire pharmaceutical product life cycle, supporting the advancement of KM from an enabler in ICH Q10 to a key consideration (both technical and regulatory) in ICH Q12.",,,PDA Journal of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology,,"Drug Development; Drug Industry; Humans; Knowledge Management; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Pharmacy; Technology, Pharmaceutical",2020-07-16,2020,2020-07-16,2021,75,1,64-90,Closed,Article,"Lipa, Martin J; Greene, Anne; Calnan, Nuala","Lipa, Martin J (Merck & Co., Inc., 770 Sumneytown Pike, West Point, PA 19486; and martin.lipa@prst.ie.; School of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, TU Dublin-City Campus, Kevin Street, Dublin 8, Ireland.); Greene, Anne (School of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, TU Dublin-City Campus, Kevin Street, Dublin 8, Ireland.); Calnan, Nuala (School of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, TU Dublin-City Campus, Kevin Street, Dublin 8, Ireland.)",,"Lipa, Martin J (MSD (United States); Technological University Dublin); Greene, Anne (Technological University Dublin); Calnan, Nuala (Technological University Dublin)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129419601,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences,

        In this paper, we analyse the impact of the Covidâ19 crisis in organizations from the point of view of knowledge management. Specifically, we address the question of technology, people and processes. We conclude, first, that KM should be put at the centre stage in 2021 because, above all, first and foremost, the Covidâ19 crisis is a crisis about knowledge, and that a massive knowledge failure has been at its core â namely, the absence of a vaccine and the cure for Covidâ19. We furthermore conclude that in organizations, there was a complete lack of âsocial knowledgeâ linked with âorganizational behaviourâ which led to an organizational crisis; quite crucially, we believe that the mentioned crisis was even fostered by the immense technology available, but continued because, despite all the value of people, there was not knowledge about processes; in fact, suddenly, the drastic change in setting caused previously competent people to become incompetent. All this leads to the third conclusion, namely, the solution of the crisis will be achieved using technology and making people competent again and teaching them the right processes.

Responsible Business Model Innovation is increasingly becoming a relevant challenge in academic research and business practice, mainly in the Asian context. Changes in business models are widely acknowledged as a key strategy for achieving long-term innovation. However, little is known about the design journey of Responsible Business Model Innovation. By applying the knowledge-based view and stakeholder theory, this paper introduces the founding pillars of Responsible Business Model Innovation, namely: Corporate Social Responsiveness, Inclusiveness, and Reflective Knowledge Exchange. Based on the analysis of extended bodies of literature published between 2011 and 2021 on business model innovation, sustainability innovation, stakeholder theory and responsible innovation, the article explores the state of the art of business ethics and dynamic capabilities in Asian organizations. Findings show that recent research in the field of sustainability and ethical values are improving the impact on business models, thus encouraging the advent of Responsible Business Model Innovation.

The current paper presents a decision support framework to evaluate the performance of organizations based on the success factors (SFs) of TQM and KM using the BCC model of data envelopment analysis (DEA). The SFs of KM are considered as input and the SFs of TQM are considered as output of the BCC model, and the efficiency scores of five pharmaceutical companies in Esfahan, Iran, are obtained. The results show that, among the aforementioned companies, three companies were recognized as efficient, while two of them were introduced as inefficient companies.

Still, its incorporation in the business field is in its early stages, particularly among small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This research aims to investigate the influence of internal and external drivers on RI and sustainable competitive advantage (SCA). The hypotheses of the study are examined through the Structural equation modeling (SEM) technique, and data were gathered from 291 owners/managers of leather manufacturing SMEs through simple random sampling. The study found that external drivers significantly and positively impact RI strategies, whereas internal drivers have an insignificant relationship with RI strategies.

Following cancellation of in-person events, a multi-faceted intervention program was established in May 2020 by Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), the World Health Organisation, and partners to strengthen national COVID-19 response coordination through public health emergency operations centres (PHEOC) utilizing continuous learning, mentorship, and networking. We present the lessons learned and reflection points. A multi-partner program coordination group was established to facilitate interventions' delivery including webinars and virtual community of practice (COP). We retrieved data from Africa CDC's program repository, synthesised major findings and describe these per thematic area. The virtual COP recorded 1,968 members and approximately 300 engagements in its initial three months. Fifty-six webinar sessions were held, providing 97 cumulative learning hours to 12,715 unique participants. Zoom data showed a return rate of 85%; 67% of webinar attendees were from Africa, and about 26 interactions occurred between participants and facilitators per session. Of 4,084 (44%) participants responding to post-session surveys, over 95% rated the topics as being relevant to their work and contributing to improving their understanding of PHEOC operationalisation. In addition, 95% agreed that the simplicity of the training delivery encouraged a greater number of public health staff to participate and spread lessons from it to their own networks.

However, the problem is that there is no resilience framework that integrates the knowledge creation process. This article introduces a new framework for increasing community resilience based on knowledge creation theory (KCT). This research aims to define the elements that support the Knowledge Creation for Community Resilience (KCCR) and to gain consensus from experts on these factors. This study was conducted using semi-structured interviews with five panellists and three rounds of Delphi technique to determine the assessment of 26 factors (including six additional factors) that have been identified by experts (30, 18 and 11 experts in rounds I, II and III, sequentially). The data analysis was carried out in several stages, and included Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient, consensus appraisal and interrater agreement (IRA) statistical evaluation. The result of the agreement level (AL) analysis shows that the majority of the constructs (96.15%) are in the 'moderate strong' category. This study shows that there is a significant consensus (with IRA index [a wg(1)] ranging from 0.529 to 1), and panellists confirm the significance of all the key constructs. Consensus was gained from experts on seven elements that support the KCCR. This study establishes a systematic, operational and multidimensional KCCR framework that combines the concepts of knowledge creation, community resilience and disaster preparedness. This framework can be used as a qualitative instrument or guidance to build community resilience based on knowledge creation and a quantitative tool for measuring community resilience in facing disasters.","The authors are most grateful to all the experts who participated in this research.

The paper develops and empirically tests a model proposing that perceived rewards influence radical innovation via the mediating mechanisms of knowledge acquisition and knowledge sharing. Data from three Indian manufacturing companies were collected using a questionnaire. Responses from 235 employees were analysed (using structural equation modeling via AMOS27) to examine the links between perceived rewards, knowledge sharing, knowledge acquisition, and radical innovation. The findings showed that: 1) perceived rewards had positive and significant relationships with radical innovation, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge sharing; 2) knowledge acquisition had a positive and significant relation with radical innovation, but knowledge sharing was not significantly related to radical innovation; and 3) knowledge acquisition mediated the relationship between perceived rewards and radical innovation. No support was found for the mediating role of knowledge sharing in radical innovation. The paper examines the overlooked role of perceived rewards in facilitating knowledge behaviours and radical innovation.

The complexity of crisis management, particularly in Iran, the unfamiliarity of the disease, and a lack of expertise, provided the foundation for researchers and implementers to propose innovative solutions. One of the most important obstacles in COVID-19 crisis management is the lack of information and the need for immediate and real-time data on the situation and appropriate solutions. Such complex problems fall into the category of semi-structured problems. In this respect, decision support systems use peopleâs mental resources with computer capabilities to improve the quality of decisions. In synergetic situations, for instance, healthcare domains cooperating with spatial solutions, coming to a decision needs logical reasoning and high-level analysis. Therefore, it is necessary to add rich semantics to different classes of involved data, find their relationships, and conceptualize the knowledge domain. For the COVID-19 case in this study, ontologies allow for querying over such established relationships to find related medical solutions based on description logic. Bringing such capabilities to a spatial decision support system (SDSS) can help with better control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ontology-based SDSS solution has been developed in this study due to the complexity of information related to coronavirus and its geospatial aspect in the city of Tehran. According to the results, ontology can rationalize different classes and properties about the userâs clinical information, various medical centers, and usersâ priority. Then, based on the userâs requests in a web-based SDSS, the system focuses on the inference made, advises the users on choosing the most related medical center, and navigates the user on a map. The ontologyâs capacity for reasoning, overcoming knowledge gaps, and combining geographic and descriptive criteria to choose a medical center all contributed to promising outcomes and the satisfaction of the sample community of evaluators.",,"This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.",GeoJournal,,,2022-10-27,2022,2022-10-27,2023,88,3,2721-2735,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Rezaei, Zahra; Vahidnia, Mohammad H.","Rezaei, Zahra (Department of Remote Sensing and GIS, Faculty of Natural Resources and Environment, Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran); Vahidnia, Mohammad H.

                  Spiritual and religious beliefs often evolve across the lifecourse and tend to be influenced by experience, time, and maturity. Despite this evolution, stereotypes persist of older adults as being inflexible in their views and resistant to new or alternative beliefs. To explore this notion, researchers surveyed a convenience sample of 152 older adults (n = 152) who identified as spiritual/religious. Over three-quarters (77.0%) reported that their relationship with God or a higher power had grown closer over time. Most reported becoming âmore liberalâ (32.2%), âmore conservativeâ (23.0%), or âmore moderateâ (17.8%) in religious perspective over time. Almost three-quarters of participants (73.7%) reported that they were âmore acceptingâ of other religionsâ, yet also âmore certainâ of their own beliefs (74.3%) in later life. These and other results challenge the stereotype of older adults as âset in their waysâ, even in terms of spiritual and religious beliefs.",,,Innovation in Aging,,,2020-12-16,2020,2020-12-16,2020-12-16,4,Suppl 1,678-679,All OA; Gold,Article,"Anderson, Keith; Garthwait, Cynthia; Vielle, Laurel","Anderson, Keith (University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, Texas, United States); Garthwait, Cynthia (University of Montana, Missoula, Montana, United States); Vielle, Laurel (University of Montana, Missoula, Montana, United States)",,"Anderson, Keith (The University of Texas at Arlington); Garthwait, Cynthia (University of Montana); Vielle, Laurel (University of Montana)",0,0,,0.0,https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/4/Supplement_1/678/34918772/igaa057.2360.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133655388,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

Knowledge management/transfer is a property of the organisational system rather than a particular technique. Hence, knowledge management/transfer is about the contextual framing in which learning focused on understanding can occur. Looking through a system lens any research field can be defined as a complex adaptive organisation, and its culture determines if and how learning and knowledge transfer (or shared learning) can occur.

Many contributors have attempted to consider and understand the sociopolitical forces involved in knowledge generation and exchange. We argue, however, that a model is still needed to adequately conceptualize and frame the knowledge networks in which these processes are embedded. We devised a model for knowledge mapping as a prerequisite for knowledge management in the context of conservation. Using great ape conservation to frame our approach, we propose that knowledge mapping should be based on 2 key principles. First, each conservation network results from the conglomeration of subnetworks of expertise producing and using knowledge. Second, beyond the research-management gradient, other dimensions, such as the scale of operation, geographic location, and organizational characteristics, must also be considered. Assessing both knowledge production and trajectory across different dimensions of the network opens new space for investigating and reducing the gap between science and action.",This project was supported by the German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity (iDiv) and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.

Emerging evidence suggests that knowledge brokering activities potentially support clinicians' research engagement, but it is unclear how best they should be used.
OBJECTIVES: This study explores how embedded researchers utilised knowledge brokering activities to engage research interested clinicians in research.
DESIGN: A longitudinal qualitative interview based study was co-designed to investigate how experienced research fellows utilise knowledge brokering activities to facilitate allied health clinicians' engagement in research.
SETTING: In one large tertiary level, regional Australian health service, research fellows were matched with research interested clinicians.
METHODS: Qualitative analysis of three longitudinal semi-structured interviews for each research fellow was undertaken. Initial descriptions of their utilisation of knowledge brokering activities were deductively coded. Reflexive thematic analysis was utilised to generate a shared explanation of clinicians' engagement in research.
RESULTS: Three research fellows facilitated 21 clinicians' participation in and leadership of clinical research projects over 12 months. They utilised all ten key knowledge brokering activities with each clinician, with differing patterns and examples. Research fellows described using linkage and exchange activities of communicating and collaborating with key stakeholders, and they tailored knowledge management products for individual's engagement. Further, they described a broader learning journey where they clarified and monitored individuals' capabilities, motivation and their contextual support for research engagement.
CONCLUSION: When research fellows chose and tailored knowledge brokering activities to align and extend clinicians' research capabilities and motivation, they created individualised learning curriculums to support clinicians' participation in and leadership of local research projects. Health and academic leaders should consider structuring embedded researcher positions to include knowledge brokering roles and activities, specifically for research interested clinicians who are ready to participate in and lead research projects.",,"The authors have not declared a specific grant for this research from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.",BMJ Open,,Australia; Humans; Knowledge; Knowledge Management; Leadership; Research Personnel,2022-04-29,2022,2022-04-29,2022-04,12,4,e060456,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mickan, S; Wenke, Rachel; Weir, Kelly; Bialocerkowski, Andrea; Noble, Christy","Mickan, S (Faculty of Health Sciences and Medicine, Bond University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia); Wenke, Rachel (Allied Health, Gold Coast Hospital and Health Service, Southport, Queensland, Australia); Weir, Kelly (Allied Health, Gold Coast Hospital and Health Service, Southport, Queensland, Australia; Griffith Health, Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia); Bialocerkowski, Andrea (Griffith Health, Griffith University - Gold Coast Campus, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia); Noble, Christy (Office of Medical Education, Faculty of Medicine, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia)","Mickan, S (Bond University)","Mickan, S (Bond University); Wenke, Rachel (Gold Coast Hospital); Weir, Kelly (Gold Coast Hospital; Griffith University); Bialocerkowski, Andrea (Griffith University); Noble, Christy (University of Queensland)",0,0,,,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/12/4/e060456.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147511066,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

Empirical analyses were conducted on 249 employee dataset using versions SPSS 26 and AMOS 26. Results illustrate an inverse correlation between perceived overqualification and knowledge hiding behavior which is partly mediated by psychological capital and moderated by person-organization fit, implying that good organizational atmosphere that builds up individual psychological capital with better person-organization fit will allow employees to work positively to reduce knowledge hiding behavior when perceived overqualified.

Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are developed to aid clinicians in decision making. Current clinical knowledge is stored in fixed templates, which are not intuitive for clinicians and limit the knowledge reusability. Knowledge graphs (KGs) store knowledge in a way that is not only intuitive to humans but also processable by computers directly. However, existing medical KGs such as UMLS and CMeKG are general purpose and thus lack enough knowledge to enable hypertension medication.
METHODS: We first construct a KG specific to hypertension medication according to the Chinese hypertension guideline and then develop the corresponding CDSS to implement hypertension medication and knowledge management. Current advances in knowledge graph representation and modelling are researched and applied in the complex medical knowledge representation. Traditional knowledge representation and KG representation are innovatively combined in the storage of the KG to enable convenient knowledge management and easy application by the CDSS. Along a predefined reasoning path in the KG, the CDSS finally accomplishes the hypertension medication by applying knowledge stored in the KG. 124 health records of a hypertension Chief Physician from Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University, are collected to evaluate the system metrics on the single drug recommendation task.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The proposed CDSS has functions of medication knowledge graph management and hypertension medication decision support. With elaborate design on knowledge representation, knowledge management is intuitive and convenient. By virtue of the KG, medication recommendations are highly visualized and explainable. Experiments on 124 health records with 90% guideline compliance collected from hospitals in single class recommendation task achieve 91%, 83% and 77% on recall, hit@3 and MRR metrics respectively, which demonstrates the quality of the KG and effectiveness of the system.",,,Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine,,"Humans; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Hypertension; Hospitals",2022-11-02,2022,2022-11-02,2022-12,227,,107220,Closed,Article,"Zhou, Gengxian; E, Haihong; Kuang, Zemin; Tan, Ling; Xie, Xiaoxuan; Li, Jundi; Luo, Haoran","Zhou, Gengxian (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China.); E, Haihong (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing 100876, China.

This article aims to investigate whether some supply chains were resilient or not and why, using a knowledge-based approach and specifically focusing on the role played by supply chain innovation in building resilience to disruptions, thanks to knowledge preparedness. The study is motivated by two main rationales: the unique situation of a global pandemic and the absence of studies providing grounded evidences of supply chain resilience in a worst-case scenario. The research is based on the assumption that knowledge preparedness introduces logistics/supply chain innovations and enables companies to prevent, detect, and respond to unpredictable negative events. By using a large-scale sample of European firms' data from the Eurostat and a multivariate regression analysis, the authors cross-study the effects of supply chain knowledge preparedness â based on innovation type and expenditures â on the international trade of goods from January to June 2020. The results confirm that the most resilient supply chains were those that had previously introduced innovations, a factor that strengthens the knowledge preparedness of firms when faced with unforeseeable supply chain disruptions.",,,Journal of International Management,,,2021-07-28,2021,2021-07-28,2022-03,28,1,100876,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Orlando, Beatrice; Tortora, Debora; Pezzi, Alberto; Bitbol-Saba, Nathalie","Orlando, Beatrice (Department of Economics and Management, University of Ferrara, Via Voltapaletto, 11, 44121 Ferrara, Italy); Tortora, Debora (University of Milano - Bicocca, Department of Business and Law, Via Bicocca degli Arcimboldi, 8, 20126 Milano, Italy); Pezzi, Alberto (Department of Business Studies, University of Roma Tre, Via Silvio D'Amico 77, 00145 Rome, Italy); Bitbol-Saba, Nathalie (Paris School of Business, 59 Rue Nationale, 75013 Paris, France)","Orlando, Beatrice (University of Ferrara)","Orlando, Beatrice (University of Ferrara); Tortora, Debora (University of Milano-Bicocca); Pezzi, Alberto (Roma Tre University); Bitbol-Saba, Nathalie (Paris School of Business)",35,35,,27.38,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intman.2021.100876,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139976730,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains","11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Studies confirm that unfortunately a large proportion of the software development outsourcing projects fails to realize anticipated benefits. Investigations into the failures of such projects divulge that in several cases software development outsourcing projects are failed because of the issues that are associated with requirements engineering process. The objective of this study is the identification and the ranking of the commonly occurring issues of the requirements engineering process in the case of software development outsourcing. For this purpose, contemporary literature has been assessed rigorously, issues faced by practitioners have been identified and three questionnaire surveys have been organized by involving experienced software development outsourcing practitioners. The Delphi technique, cut-off value method and 50% rule have also been employed. The study explores 150 issues (129 issues from literature and 21 from industry) of requirements engineering process for software development outsourcing, groups the 150 issues into 7 identified categories and then extricates 43 customarily or commonly arising issues from the 150 issues. Founded on 'frequency of occurrence' the 43 customarily arising issues have been ranked with respect to respective categories (category-wise ranking) and with respect to all the categories (overall ranking). Categories of the customarily arising issues have also been ranked. The issues' identification and ranking contribute to design proactive software project management plan for dealing with software development outsourcing failures and attaining conjectured benefits of the software development outsourcing.","The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University for funding this work through research group no.RG-1441-490.

Although the literature suggests various approaches to developing dynamic capabilities, they are formulated in general terms, and doubts can be raised about the links between actions. There is also a lack of empirical research indicating the links between activities in the process of developing dynamic capabilities and their influence on the effectiveness of an organization. The aim of the study is to formulate a proposal for a model of the process of developing dynamic capabilities aimed at increasing the economic effectiveness of a company and to determine the links between the activities in the model. The theoretical contribution of the paper consists in presenting a model of the process of developing dynamic capabilities aimed at increasing the economic effectiveness of the company. The results presented in the paper refer to an empirical examination of the model of developing dynamic capabilities, covering five activities: searching for opportunities; knowledge management and learning; coordination; configuration and reconfiguration; and organizational adaptation. The study also includes an examination of the possible impact the components of the dynamic capabilities building process have on a company's performance. The study uses the survey method and data was obtained from top managers. The conclusion, based on data from 471 Polish companies, was made using structural equation modelling. The results of the empirical research suggest that the individual activities in the process of developing dynamic capabilities are interconnected, and through mutual interactions and couplings, they positively affect the economic effectiveness of an enterprise. The results indicate that searching for opportunities is the precursor, and the main factor influencing the other activities in the process, which suggests that managers should focus on improving activities in this area.","This research was funded by the National Science Centre Poland, grant number DEC-2013/11/B/HS4/00697, referring to the dynamic capabilities of Polish enterprises.

Many PHEIs are facing financial distress and struggling because of decreasing budgets and declining revenue. Thus, carving unique strategies that direct the institution to focus on its core competencies, making additional budget cuts without compromising quality, developing new revenue streams, embracing new technology, and offering affordable programs, will ultimately lead to financial success. Frugal innovation (FI) can shed light on these challenges. Methods: This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate and analyse prior research that focused on FI within the sphere of intellectual capital (IC) and information technology capabilities (ITC) research, and their relationships in PHEIs. Transfield's five phases were employed to extract journal articles published over a thirty-year period (1990 to 2020) from major online databases using keyword searches. Although an initial search generated 76,025 papers, the search for IC and FI yielded 41 papers, and finally only two papers were selected as they clearly related IC with FI. Results: There was a research gap in the literature published from 1990 to 2020 regarding IC applications to achieve FI. This work revealed that IC and ITC research for FI in PHEI remain insufficiently explored. Â  Conclusions: Further research is required on the evaluation model of IC, ITC and FI, methodologies, empirical analysis, and the development of measurement metrics. A limitation to this study is the number of keywords selected.","This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, under the Fundamental Research Grant Fund (FRGS/1/2020/SS02/MMU/02/3).

Three research objectives were addressed, namely (1) the publication patterns in the field, (2) the most influential articles and researched keywords in the field, and (3) the visualization of the scholarly network between GN and GS researchers between the years 2010 and 2020. On the basis of the PRISMA statement, longitudinal research data were retrieved from the Web of Science and analyzed. Thirty-two AI-related keywords were used to retrieve relevant quality articles. Finally, 149 articles accompanying the follow-up 8838 citing articles were identified as eligible sources. A co-citation network analysis was adopted to scientifically visualize the intellectual structure of AI research in GN and GS networks. The results revealed that the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom are the most productive GN countries; by contrast, China and India are the most productive GS countries. Next, the 10 most frequently co-cited AI research articles in the IS domain were identified. Third, the scholarly networks of AI research in the GN and GS areas were visualized. Between 2010 and 2015, GN researchers in the IS domain focused on applied research involving intelligent systems (e.g., decision support systems); between 2016 and 2020, GS researchers focused on big data applications (e.g., geospatial big data research). Both GN and GS researchers focused on technology adoption research (e.g., AI-related products and services) throughout the investigated period. Overall, this paper reveals the intellectual structure of the scholarly network on AI research and several applications in the IS literature.

We argue for commitment to the model of a global learning health system to facilitate rapid knowledge translation supporting health care decision making in the face of emerging diseases.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We frame the evolution of knowledge in the COVID-19 crisis in terms of learning theory, and present a view of what has occurred during the pandemic to rapidly derive and share knowledge as an (underdeveloped) instance of a global learning health system. We identify the key role of information technologies for electronic data capture and data sharing, computational modelling, evidence synthesis, and knowledge dissemination. We further highlight gaps in the system and barriers to full realisation of an efficient and effective global learning health system.
CONCLUSIONS: The need for a global knowledge ecosystem supporting rapid learning from clinical practice has become more apparent than ever during the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued effort to realise the vision of a global learning health system, including establishing effective approaches to data governance and ethics to support the system, is imperative to enable continuous improvement in our clinical care.","KV is supported by numerous grants from the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia.

It is necessary to promote the knowledge sharing of heterogeneous individuals such as design, technology, market, and sociologists. This paper discusses the influence of negative individual knowledge management from the perspective of knowledge-sharing hostility and knowledge manipulation on the performance of new product development. To examine our hypotheses, we conducted a questionnaire survey of 438 employees in China. The results show that although knowledge manipulation contributes to individual innovation performance, it has an inverted U-shaped curve relationship with the team's product development performance. The hostility of knowledge sharing induces knowledge manipulation, which indirectly influences the performance of new product development. The coordination flexibility of R&D teams positively moderates the impact of knowledge manipulation on new product development.

In response to evidence emerging from this research, the Community-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) policy was promulgated in 1999 to scale-up results. However, during the first decade of CHPS operation, national monitoring showed that its pace of coverage expansion was unacceptably slow. In 2010, the Ghana Health Service launched a 5-year plausibility trial of CHPS reform for testing ways to accelerate scale-up. This initiative, known as the Ghana Essential Health Intervention Program (GEHIP), included a knowledge management component for establishing congruence of knowledge generation and flow with the operational system that GEHIP evidence was intended to reform. Four Upper East Region districts served as trial areas, while seven districts were comparison areas. Interventions tested means of developing the upward flow of information based on perspectives of district managers, sub-district supervisors and community-level workers. GEHIP also endeavoured to improve procedures for the downward flow and utilization of policy guidelines. Field exchanges were convened for providing national, regional and district leaders with opportunities for participatory learning about GEHIP implementation innovations. This systems approach facilitated the process of augmenting the communication of evidence with practical field experience. Scientific rigor associated with the production of evidence was thereby integrated into management decision-making processes in ways that institutionalized learning at all levels. The GEHIP knowledge management system functioned as a prototype for guiding the planning of a national knowledge management strategy.

As such, these entities require leadership capable of managing transformations. Transformational leadership is an effective leadership model that focuses on adapting to existing environmental circumstances whether through internal information, human and monetary resources, or different external variables. This study aims to highlight the characteristics of transformational leadership and their effects on the public universities in Saudi particularly, this study enlightens the urgent need to test the behavioral intentions in the public universities in Saudi Arabia. To achieve this goal, many major databases were used. The period of the study was set from 2011 to 2020 as the topic of the study is the current transformational leadership within the public universities in Saudi Arabia. There was a total of 47,400,000 studies on transformational leadership on Google, however, only 22 studies were reviewed which were entirely conducted in Saudi Arabian Universities. The results demonstrated that in the public universities in Saudi, transformational leadership is practiced across four dimensions: ideal effect, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individual consideration. The documentary research approach was used to review the most recent aspects of administrative literature on the theory of transformational leadership and its organizational outcomes. In addition, NVIVO 11 was used to make a thematic analysis of the linkages between transformational leadership and organizational outcomes: organizational commitment, knowledge management practices, morale, employee empowerment, level of job satisfaction, administrative creativity, organizational citizenship behavior, and the level of transformation toward quality and job enrichment. Therefore, behavioral tendencies such as organizational commitment, empowerment, job satisfaction, and knowledge management practices have been studied more interestingly and critically. Furthermore, these behavioral aspects need to be explored more in public universities in Saudi Arabia.",The author thanks the Deanship of Scientific Research and RSSU at King Saud University for their technical support and funding.,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,2021-11-10,2021,2021-11-10,,12,,682092,All OA; Gold,Article,"Alessa, Ghuzayyil Saad","Alessa, Ghuzayyil Saad (Department of Public Administration, College of Business Administration, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia)","Alessa, Ghuzayyil Saad (King Saud University)","Alessa, Ghuzayyil Saad (King Saud University)",4,4,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.682092/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142490984,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,

All countries have realized that the only way to get real growth and development and solve their problems is to use what they have learned from research.
Methods: A descriptive and analytic type of study was conducted with the help of experts in the field of health research. The components affecting the research system were obtained via process approach and content analysis methods, and then the position of each component was identified by the Mic Mac technique.
Results: Seventeen influential structural components in the health research system were identified. The leadership and management components had the most direct and indirect influence among other components. The health promotion component had a greater dependency than the other components.
Conclusion: All health systems need to provide adequate financial resources and manpower to provide a useful research system. Human resources are the most important inputs to such a system. Components such as the research process, research sustainability, quality, or innovation in research can play a balancing role. Having the right infrastructures for creating, transferring, developing, and getting access to knowledge makes it possible to do systematic science. It is hoped that this science will be used in other results of the health research system, like improving the effectiveness or promoting health.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank all participants and experts in this research.

The existing literature mainly focuses on the identification of antecedents and consequences of knowledge hiding. The studies pertaining to the top management role in creating a culture that stops concealing knowledge within an organization are limited. To fill that gap, the paper empirically address the knowledge sharing culture and to explore the management support to avoid knowledge hiding culture in an organization. This study based on an empirical study carried out in a United Kingdom-based laboratory within a high-tech global corporation, in which the atmosphere appeared conducive to knowledge sharing, and knowledge transfer appeared voluntary and spontaneous. The paper seeks to address why members of the case organization is reluctant about knowledge hiding among themselves. The study reveals that the management role is important in creating a culture that help discourage employees to withhold knowledge. The paper identifies the actions that top management takes to stop concealing knowledge within an organization. This study has provided several contributions.

This case illustrates the use of early stakeholder engagement and Nominal Group Technique (NGT) to cultivate a CoP in a complex multidisciplinary system: colorectal cancer screening in northern Canada.
METHODS: Stakeholders in the Northwest Territories, Canada were recruited and co-designed a workshop with authors to introduce CoP concepts and identify priorities. At the workshop NGT was used to identify and prioritize gaps in process, practice, and evidence for the CoP to focus on. An anonymous polling system was used to obtain workshop participants' feedback on the process.
RESULTS: The co-design process integrated stakeholders' perspectives in developing a workshop. Using NGT, the gap analysis identified 23 areas of focus for the CoP, among which, the highest priorities were identified: communication between clinicians and with patients, and identification of screening eligibility in the electronic medical record. Participants found the process to be useful, educational, and interesting. There was unanimous interest in moving forward with developing a CoP.
CONCLUSION: A co-designed workshop and NGT were useful in laying the foundation for a CoP in a complex multidisciplinary environment.
POLICY STATEMENT: This case shows the utility of a co-designed workshop and NGT in starting a CoP: a knowledge management system that would provide critical insight into colorectal cancer screening policies for the region.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"Support for this meeting was provided by the CIHR Planning and Dissemination Grant [422436, 2019] and Hotii Tsâeeda Support for Patient Oriented Research NWT Unit [153411, 2019]",Journal of Cancer Policy,,Canada; Colorectal Neoplasms; Delivery of Health Care; Early Detection of Cancer; Humans; Stakeholder Participation,2021-02-09,2021,2021-02-09,2021-06,28,,100274,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Smith, H.A.; Kuziemsky, C.; Champion, C.; Fung-Kee-Fung, M.; Boushey, R.; Kandola, K.; Tessier, A.","Smith, H.A.

Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the effect of bank employees' health beliefs about COVID-19 on knowledge sharing mediated by their self-efficacy. From the perspective of social cognitive theory and the health belief model, this study investigates whether employees' perception of susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 affects formal as well as informal knowledge sharing through knowledge sharing self-efficacy. A sample of 407 bank employees (200 women and 207 men) in China was used for the study. The formulated hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling and bootstrapping. The results showed that employees' perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 significantly undermines formal and informal knowledge sharing self-efficacy. However, there was no significant difference in the extent of its indirect effects on formal and informal knowledge sharing. Further, employees' perceived severity of COVID-19 had no effect on knowledge sharing self-efficacy and on formal and informal knowledge sharing, which could have resulted from the COVID-19 outbreak in China.",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,2022-07-27,2022,2022-07-27,,13,,882029,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wang, Tianjiao; Jiang, Cheng; Chen, Qiran","Wang, Tianjiao (Institute of Economics of Education, Peking University, Beijing, China); Jiang, Cheng (Institute of Economics of Education, Peking University, Beijing, China); Chen, Qiran (Institute of Economics of Education, Peking University, Beijing, China)","Jiang, Cheng (Peking University)","Wang, Tianjiao (Peking University); Jiang, Cheng (Peking University); Chen, Qiran (Peking University)",1,1,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.882029/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149788780,52 Psychology,

A community-engaged knowledge hub (CEKH) has the potential for transdisciplinary and cross-sectorial collaboration between knowledge producers, mobilizers, and users to develop more relevant and effective research practices as well as to increase community capacity in terms of knowledge production. Objective: To summarize existing original research articles on knowledge hubs or platforms and to identify the benefits, challenges, and ways to address challenges when developing a CEKH. Methods: This study followed a systematic integrative review design. Following a comprehensive search of academic and grey literature databases, we screened 9030 unique articles using predetermined inclusion criteria and identified 20 studies for the final synthesis. We employed thematic analysis to summarize the results. Results: The focus of the majority of these knowledge mobilization hubs was related to health and wellness. Knowledge hubs have a multitude of benefits for the key stakeholders including academics, communities, service providers, and policymakers, including improving dissemination processes, providing more effective community interventions, ensuring informed care, and creating policy assessment tools. Challenges in creating knowledge hubs are generally consistent for all stakeholders, rather than for individual stakeholders, and typically pertain to funding, resources, and conflicting perspectives. As such, strategies to address challenges are also emphasized and should be executed in unison. Conclusions: This study informs the development of a future CEKH through the identification of the benefits, challenges, and strategies to mitigate challenges when developing knowledge hubs. This study addresses a literature gap regarding the comparisons of knowledge hubs and stakeholder experiences.","Details about the members of the Newcomer Research Network (NRN) are available at https://www.ucalgary.ca/network/newcomer-research/home.

We take employee motivation in terms of approach motivation and avoidance motivation and examine moderating role of the former in case of the psychological ownership â knowledge sharing relationship, and the latter in case of the psychological ownership â knowledge hiding relationship. We examine these relationships on data collected during a pandemic (i.e., COVID-19).Â Data are collected from 217 individuals working in knowledge intensive high-tech organizations and educational institutes. Hypotheses are tested using structural equation modelling (SEM).Â Results show that stronger feelings of psychological ownership lead to both positive work behavior (i.e., knowledge sharing) as well as negative work behavior (i.e., knowledge hiding). Furthermore, approach motivation positively moderates the positive relationship between psychological ownership and knowledge sharing. A moderating role of avoidance motivation, however, is not confirmed.Â Research has ignored the role of different types of employee motivation, particularly approach motivation vis-Ã -vis knowledge behaviors. Furthermore, by examining these relationships in the context of a Pandemic (i.e., COVID-19), we offer some interesting insights and offer implications for management practice.

We built our research upon the recognized importance of management tools for organizational working under Industry 4.0 settings and explored the key personal and organizational drivers of management tool usage. Calculations were performed based on the responses of 222 employees working in organizations across Europe. The results revealed that, among personal drivers, a higher level of education leads to significantly higher usage of six sigma, rapid prototyping, outsourcing, customer relationship management, knowledge management, core competencies, and strategic planning. More experienced employees use significantly more six sigma, total quality management, supply chain management, knowledge management, and core competences than their less experienced peers. The impact of organizational drivers is substantially weaker, where only industry shows significant influence, indicating that lean production, six sigma, and supply chain management are used more in manufacturing than in service organizations.

While quality management practices can clearly improve the quality of these organizations in several aspects, empirical research for quality management in educational organizations is sparse because of the lack of suitable frameworks for assessing quality. In this paper, we present the first large-scale empirical study of implementing quality management practices in educational organizations in the United States. It is based on seven years of objective data for quality assessments by external professional reviewers as part of the U.S. governmentâs Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) program. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the reliability and robustness of the Baldrige model as an effective quality assessment for educational organizations. Controlling for the applicantâs year, our findings show that Information and knowledge management is a key influencer and predictor of Customer satisfaction and focus, and Management of process quality is a key influencer and predictor of Quality and operations results. This study also provides effective insight and recommendations for how to improve quality systems and achieve business excellence in educational organizations using the Baldrige model.

Organizations need to implement knowledge management (KM) processes as well as organizational mechanisms transforming collective knowledge into a learning organizational capability. Literature identifies knowledge sharing (KS) as a fundamental KM process. Moreover, KM was found to be a prerequisite to a learning organization. Unfortunately, organizational initiatives promoting KS are challenged with the hoarding wisdom, âknowledge is power.â Literature has researched intrinsic and extrinsic motivations affecting KS intention. The rational action theory (RAT) explains the embedded utility function merging these motivations. Despite many studies, the dynamics of KS behavior needs further examination. This paper is an attempt to frame the KS behavior using game theory and RAT. We represent individualsâ perceived utility in two functions: knowledge and trustworthiness. This limits the perceived utility to personal enjoyment and reciprocity, which could be viewed as establishing a baseline KS behavior. We use the assurance game framework to incubate the two utility functions. Finally, we argue that KS intention is actually a dynamic state within a KS strategy. We identify five KS strategies: cooperation, defection, tit-for-tat, unforgiving, and random. It is the performance of these strategies that needs to be studied. Several scenarios are simulated to observe the progression of knowledge within each strategy. Interestingly, two strategies start with positive KS intention yet end up converging with those who started with negative KS intention.

Drawing on the cognitive appraisal theory of stress and coping as a unique theoretical lens to explicate how knowledge hiding behaviors happen, this study investigates the mediating effect of job stress in the relationship between emotional intelligence (EI) and knowledge hiding behaviors. We conducted a field study with 193 full-time employees in smart healthcare firms to test our hypotheses. Results supported the mediating effects of job stress in accounting for the relationship between EI and knowledge hiding behaviors.

Many PHEIs are facing financial distress and struggling because of decreasing budgets and declining revenue. Thus, carving unique strategies that direct the institution to focus on its core competencies, making additional budget cuts without compromising quality, developing new revenue streams, embracing new technology, and offering affordable programs, will ultimately lead to financial success. Frugal innovation (FI) can shed light on these challenges. Methods: This paper presents a systematic literature review to investigate and analyse prior research that focused on FI within the sphere of intellectual capital (IC) and information technology capabilities (ITC) research, and their relationships in PHEIs. Transfield's five phases were employed to extract journal articles published over a thirty-year period (1990 to 2020) from major online databases using keyword searches. Although an initial search generated 76,025 papers, the search for IC and FI yielded 41 papers, and finally only two papers were selected as they clearly related IC with FI. Results: There was a research gap in the literature published from 1990 to 2020 regarding IC applications to achieve FI. This work revealed that IC and ITC research for FI in PHEI remain insufficiently explored. Â  Conclusions: Further research is required on the evaluation model of IC, ITC and FI, methodologies, empirical analysis, and the development of measurement metrics. A limitation to this study is the number of keywords selected.",,"This work was supported by the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia, under the Fundamental Research Grant Fund (FRGS/1/2020/SS02/MMU/02/3).

METHODS: A broad search of the medical literature indexed in PubMed was conducted. The search terms 'ontology'/'ontologies' or 'medical knowledge management' for the dates 2020-2021 (search conducted November 26, 2021) returned 9,608 records. These were pre-screened based on a review of the titles for relevance to health inclusivity, bias, social and contextual factors, and health behaviours. Among these, 109 papers were selected for in-depth reviewing based on full text, from which 22 were selected for inclusion in this survey.
RESULTS: Selected papers were grouped into three themes, each addressing one aspect of the overall challenge for medical knowledge management. The first theme addressed the development of ontologies for social and contextual factors broadening the scope of health information. The second theme addressed the need for synthesis and translation of knowledge across historical disciplinary boundaries to address inequities and bias. The third theme encompassed a growing interest in the semantics of datasets used to train medical artificial intelligence systems and on how to ensure they are free of bias.
CONCLUSIONS: Medical knowledge management and semantic resources have much to offer efforts to tackle bias and enhance health inclusivity.

It is expected that the use of online learning in higher education promote knowledge sharing among students and the sharing of knowledge result in the improvement of reflective thinking among them. As such, we examined the knowledge sharing behavior among the undergraduate students in online learning English literature courses, the studentâ perceptions towards reflective thinking, the relationship between the studentsâ knowledge sharing and reflective thinking, and finally, we tested a structural model of factors affecting knowledge sharing components, knowledge sharing, and reflective thinking. The data were collected through two surveys of 104 Iranian English literature students. A Pearsonâs correlation coefficient and path analysis were used to analyze the data and to generate a model. The results showed that the studentsâ online knowledge sharing behavior and their perceptions towards reflective thinking are at unacceptable levels. Furthermore, a significant relationship was found between factors affecting knowledge sharing with the studentsâ knowledge sharing behavior, and between knowledge sharing and reflective thinking.

We saw an even greater need to find novel ways to collaborate during the pandemic due to limited in-person meetings and travel restrictions. The purpose of this project is to accelerate collaborations in learning health systems with online technologies to improve communication, education, and knowledge management.   METHODS We developed Alicanto Cloud, an online collaboration platform for healthcare professionals to support learning health systems. Alicanto aims to help groups communicate, share educational resources, discuss complex clinical cases across institutions and countries. Alicanto provides multiple ways for users to create synchronous and asynchronous discussions. Alicanto was developed by the BIDMC Division of Clinical Informatics in collaboration with local and international colleagues with a specific focus on global health and capacity building.   RESULTS Alicanto is being used worldwide for cancer, pediatrics, and diabetes collaborations. Online communities use Alicanto to standardize care guidelines, disseminate clinical care best practices, provide online training, conduct virtual tumor boards, and improve knowledge management. Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center has used Alicanto to connect 13 hospitals and has completed over 600 virtual tumor board case discussions. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute uses Alicanto as an online cancer training network for sub-Saharan Africa. Doctors from Joslin Clinic have used Alicanto to create a global diabetes education network. We will discuss lessons learned in implementing these networks and best practices for accelerating the process of evidence synthesis to dissemination and capacity building.   CONCLUSION Communities of practice can accelerate their communications and collaborations with the appropriate tools and platforms tailored to their network needs.

In contrast with conventional manufacturing (CM), AM allows the development of a product from a smaller amount of raw material, while allowing an improvement in properties in terms of weight and functionality. Its production flexibility and creativity in terms of materials have enabled not only the industry to use this technology, but also has been used in healthcare (e.g., in the production of human tissue) and by the final consumer. Despite the invaluable opportunities that this technology could provide, the uncertainties concerning its future developments and impacts on business models remain. New business models in AM will convey the need to: specialize the workforce in the design of new parts produced locally or remotely; regulation in the use and sharing of intellectual property rights by partner companies or between users; regulate the possibility of reverse engineering of highly customized products; etc. The present research proposes a conceptual maturity model to support the phases of evolution of AM in the industry, in supply chains, and in terms of open business models.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Florinda Matos declares her interest as an Associate Editor for Heliyon.,"Authors gratefully acknowledge the funding of Project KM3D (PTDC/EME-SIS/32232/2017), supported by through FundaÃ§Ã£o para a CiÃªncia e a Tecnologia, Portugal.

US population demographics are shifting as the population ages, which leaves the field of health care poised to lose key leaders and employees to retirement at a time when patient care has grown more complex. This means health care will lose its core of key employees at a time when skilled leadership and specialized knowledge is most needed and directly impacts health care's ability to deliver quality care. Operational succession planning (OSP) may be one solution to manage this looming challenge in health care, as the process identifies and develops the next generation of leadership. Thus, this exploratory national study used a quantitative and cross-sectional design to examine the relationship between OSP and employee turnover. Demographic and 10-point Likert scale data were collected from n = 66 medical practices, using an online survey instrument. Data were analyzed using various descriptive and inferential statistical methods. Distribution (frequency and chi-square) analyses of the study sample, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and regression analyses were performed across seven demographic characteristics of the medical practices: Specialty, Ownership Structure, Number of full-time equivalent (FTE) Physicians, Number of FTE Clinical Employees, Number of FTE Nonclinical Employees, Number of FTE Employees Left Position, and Region.

This study aimed to design a model of PRM in general hospitals using the combination of the analytic hierarchy process and interpretive structural modeling (ISM).
METHODS: This was an applied and cross-sectional study conducted in 2020 at three stages. At the first stage, using a systematic review, factors affecting PRM were identified. In the second stage, these factors were prioritized based on the pair-wise comparisons. In the third stage, the interaction levels of the factors were modeled for the general hospitals using ISM through the use of the MICMAC technique and Excel 2007 software.
RESULTS: The results showed that ""integrated information system,"" ""registration of the patient's essential information,"" and ""right data at the correct time"" were the first to third priority in implementing PRM in the general hospitals. In the final model of ISM, three levels of effective factors were extracted, and 10, 4, and 6 factors were identified in the first, second, and third levels, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Establishing the PRM strategy in the hospital, in addition to executive and managerial requirements, depends on the existence of an electronic customer relationship management system, and the choice of new technology, as well as the integration of information systems and technology culture, should be given special attention by managers.",,,Journal of Education and Health Promotion,,,2021-09-30,2021,2021-09-30,2021,10,1,333,All OA; Gold,Article,"Meskarpour-Amiri, Mohammad; Bahadori, Mohammadkarim; Rahmati, Fatemeh; Ravangard, Ramin; Yaghoubi, Maryam","Meskarpour-Amiri, Mohammad (Health Management Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran); Bahadori, Mohammadkarim (Health Management Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran); Rahmati, Fatemeh (Health Research Center, Life Style Institute, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran); Ravangard, Ramin (Department of Health Services Management, School of Management and Medical Information Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; Health Human Resources Research Center, School of Management and Medical Information Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran); Yaghoubi, Maryam (Health Management Research Center, Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran)","Yaghoubi, Maryam (Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences)","Meskarpour-Amiri, Mohammad (Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences); Bahadori, Mohammadkarim (Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences); Rahmati, Fatemeh (Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences); Ravangard, Ramin (Shiraz University of Medical Sciences; Shiraz University of Medical Sciences); Yaghoubi, Maryam (Baqiyatallah University of Medical Sciences)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_1040_20,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142429993,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 42 Health Sciences,

Nevertheless, the nature of the operational processes implemented by practitioners within clubs and national federations remains unexplored. The aim of the present study, therefore, was to survey elite youth professional football academies from around the world regarding the operational processes adopted by their medical and performance units.
Methods: Of the 50 organizations invited, 10 national federations and 25 clubs took part in the survey resulting in a response rate of 70% (95% confidence interval, 56%-81%). The respondents represented three groups: senior club and academy management, performance, and medical staff.
Results: The majority (60%-90%) of clubs and national federations reported strategic alignment between senior and academy medical and performance units as well as between academy medical and performance units. Survey responses indicated substantial heterogeneity in the composition and number of medical and performance professionals employed in academies. The majority of respondents agreed their medical and performance departments were effective in utilizing staff knowledge and external sources of knowledge to inform their practice (56%-80%). Performance staff (40%-50%) and physiotherapists (30%-32%) were deemed most influential in injury prevention programmes. During the return-to-play process, the influence of specific practitioners in the medical and performance units was dependent upon the phase of return-to-play. Shared decision-making was common practice amongst performance and medical staff in injury prevention and return-to-play processes. Medical and performance data were generally centralized across the first team and academy in majority (50%-72%) of clubs and national federations. Data were integrated within the same data management system to a higher degree in clubs (68%) vs. national federations (40%). Research and development activity were reported for most academies (50%-72%), and generally led by the head of performance (37%) or team doctor (21%). Research activities were largely undertaken via internal staff (~100%), academic collaborations (50%-88%) and/or external consultants and industry partnerships (77%-83%) in the national federation and clubs.
Conclusion: Collectively, these findings provide a detailed overview regarding key operational processes delivered by medical and performance practitioners working in elite football academies.","We would like to acknowledge the commitment and expertise of the Aspire in the World Fellows without whom this study would not have been possible.

Based on provincial panel data from 2008 to 2018, this paper examines the existence, scope, and induced control of the green governance peer effects using a spatial econometric approach. The study found that the following: (1) Influenced by the top-level design of the central government and the contradictory governance of regional development, the local governments form the peer effects in green governance activities. The existence of spatial relationships makes local governments dependent on a solid financial support system and a basis for industrial transformation, thus counteracting regional competition for green governance. (2) The green governance peer effects tend to decay with increasing geographical distance but do not disappear across regional boundaries under either spatial interaction framework. (3) Considering the impact of green governance policy systems and regional heterogeneity, the green governance peer effects decrease in the eastern, western, and central regions in that order. (4) Further, the influencing factors show that the green governance peer effects arise from intra-local government competition under the decentralization of power between the central and local governments. The competition for scales and the relative performance appraisal system reinforces the peer motivation of each subject. (5) The strong correlation of green governance willingness indicates that local governments cannot escape from will-led emotional behavior, and personal interests and governance motivation further drive the formation of pseudo-rational decisions, ultimately leading to irrational group decisions.",We thank Ruili Zhou for her communication efforts.,This research was funded by Program of Shanghai Planning Office of Philosophy and Social Science of China (No. 2020BGL023).,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Economic Development; Environmental Policy; Government; Local Government,2022-01-06,2022,2022-01-06,2023-05,30,22,61304-61323,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Liu, Hongda; Zhou, Ruili; Yao, Pinbo; Zhang, Jijian","Liu, Hongda (School of Economics & Management, Tongji University, 200092, Shanghai, China; School of Management, Shanghai University, 200444, Shanghai, China); Zhou, Ruili (China University of Petroleum, Beijing, China); Yao, Pinbo (School of Management, Shanghai University, 200444, Shanghai, China); Zhang, Jijian (School of Finance and Economics, Jiangsu University, 212013, Zhenjiang, China)","Liu, Hongda (Tongji University; Shanghai University)","Liu, Hongda (Tongji University; Shanghai University); Zhou, Ruili (China University of Petroleum, Beijing); Yao, Pinbo (Shanghai University); Zhang, Jijian (Jiangsu University)",16,16,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11356-021-17901-9.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144440533,44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography; 4407 Policy and Administration,

Nurses are major users of digital health technologies and graduates need to be well-prepared and confident to use the different available clinical systems competently as they transition from education to practice.
Aim: To explore undergraduate nursing students' self-perceptions of informatics competence, set within a larger research project.
Method: Descriptive, exploratory cross-sectional research design, with online self-assessment survey of undergraduate nursing students (nââ=ââ142). Data were analysed with descriptive, correlation and comparative statistics.
Results: Participants' perceived overall mean informatics competency was at the level of somewhat competent, with only 40.84% (nââ=ââ58) at the level of competent. The highest mean value was in foundational information and communication skills and the lowest in information and knowledge management. Formal informatics education within curriculum was limited and lacked uniformity, as was prior exposure to important simulated informatics tools in preparation for practice. Factors including academic year level, computer experience and previous experience using clinical systems had a significant impact on participants' perceived informatics competency.
Conclusion: Even though informatics competence is vital for clinical practice, with technology becoming pervasive within healthcare, nursing students' preparedness for digital health was sub-optimal.

Yet, the rapidly evolving nature of these events poses significant challenges for guidance development and dissemination strategies predicated on well-understood concepts and clearly defined access and distribution pathways. Taxonomies are an important but underutilized tool for guidance authoring, dissemination and updating in such dynamic scenarios.
OBJECTIVE: To design a rapid, semi-automated method for sampling and developing a PH guidance taxonomy using widely available Web crawling tools and streamlined manual content analysis.
METHODS: Iterative samples of guidance documents were taken from four state PH agency websites, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and the World Health Organization. Documents were used to derive and refine a preliminary taxonomy of COVID-19 PH guidance via content analysis.
RESULTS: Eight iterations of guidance document sampling and taxonomy revisions were performed, with a final corpus of 226 documents. The preliminary taxonomy contains 110 branches distributed between three major domains: stakeholders (24 branches), settings (25 branches) and topics (61 branches). Thematic saturation measures indicated rapid saturation (â¤5% change) for the domains of ""stakeholders"" and ""settings"", and ""topic""-related branches for clinical decision-making. Branches related to business reopening and economic consequences remained dynamic throughout sampling iterations.
CONCLUSION: The PH guidance taxonomy can support public health agencies by aligning guidance development with curation and indexing strategies; supporting targeted dissemination; increasing the speed of updates; and enhancing public-facing guidance repositories and information retrieval tools. Taxonomies are essential to support knowledge management activities during rapidly evolving scenarios such as disease outbreaks and natural disasters.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,,COVID-19; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Pandemics; Public Health; SARS-CoV-2,2021-06-28,2021,2021-06-28,2021-08,120,,103852,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Taber, Peter; Staes, Catherine J; Phengphoo, Saifon; Rocha, Elisa; Lam, Adria; Del Fiol, Guilherme; Maviglia, Saverio M; Rocha, Roberto A","Taber, Peter (Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States.

Five electronic databases were searched for quantitative studies. The extracted data were systematically analyzed and visualized in boxplots. The results show an increasing prevalence of smartphones and medical apps in clinical practice, especially among junior physicians. Current applications can be subdivided into four categories: Communication and Organization, Documentation and Monitoring, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Decision Support, and Education. Among them, there is a large number of applications with a direct impact on physicians' clinical actions and therefore on patients' health and data security.

Although there are some competency frameworks in this field, there is no one specifically for Ph.D. educational programs in HIM. We aimed to develop a competency framework for Ph.D. programs in HIM in Iran.
METHODS: We firstly developed a list of competencies based on those published in the literature or by related associations in nine domains and 51 sub-domains. We used the modified Delphi technique and invited Ph.D. students/graduates in HIM and related faculty members throughout the country to participate. Competencies with more than 75% agreement were considered as high priority competencies and those with 50% to 75% agreement as a medium priority. Competencies with less than 50% agreement were dropped. After two rounds, the competency framework was finalized.
RESULTS: All suggested competencies were considered a high priority in the first round. Based on suggestions, two new domains (health knowledge management and information technology) and 20 new sub-competencies were added and then accepted in the second round. The final framework includes these competency domains: health data and information management; health data analytics; information technology; teaching competencies; research competencies; health information technology and digital health; health information classifications, terminologies, and ontologies; health information systems governance; managerial competencies; health knowledge management; and digital health entrepreneurship.
CONCLUSION: This framework suggests a list of competencies in 11 domains and 71 sub-domains for Ph.D. students/graduates in HIM that should be considered for the development of future curricula for these educational programs.","We would like to thank all students, graduates, and professors who freely participated in this study.

However, there is limited knowledge about how the de-implementation of LVC is governed and what challenges might be involved. In this study, we aimed to (1) identify key stakeholdersâ activities in relation to de-implementing LVC in Sweden at the national governance level and (2) identify challenges involved in the national governance of the de-implementation of LVC.MethodsWe used a purposeful sampling strategy to identify stakeholders in Sweden having a potential role in governing the de-implementation of LVC at a national level. Twelve informants from nine stakeholder agencies/organizations were recruited using snowball sampling. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, transcribed and analysed using inductive thematic analysis.ResultsFour potential activities for governing the de-implementation of LVC at a national level were identified: recommendations, health technology assessment, control over pharmaceutical products and a national system for knowledge management. Challenges involved included various vested interests that result in the maintenance of LVC and a low overall priority of working with the de-implementation of LVC compared with the implementation of new evidence. Ambiguous evidence made it difficult to clearly determine whether a practice was LVC. Unclear roles, where none of the stakeholders perceived that they had a formal mandate to govern the de-implementation of LVC, further contributed to the challenges involved in governing that de-implementation.ConclusionsVarious activities were performed to govern the de-implementation of LVC at a national level in Sweden; however, these were limited and had a lower priority relative to the implementation of new methods. Challenges involved relate to unfavourable change incentives, ambiguous evidence, and unclear roles to govern the de-implementation of LVC. Addressing these challenges could make the national-level governance of de-implementation more systematic and thereby help create favourable conditions for reducing LVC in healthcare.",We would like to thank all participants who contributed to our study.,"Open access funding provided by Karolinska Institute.

The search pattern considers ontology design and machine learning techniques for extracting ATHMed data. The framework operates on a semantically annotated corpus and delivers a contextual and multi-word search pattern against its knowledge base. In line with design science research, preliminary data were collected in this study, and a proposed strategy was developed toward processing, storing and retrieving data. While reviewing literature and interview data to reflect on the existing challenges, these findings suggest the need for a system with the capability of retrieving and archiving ATHMed in Ghana.

The European Joint Programme for Soil (EJP SOIL) started in 2020 with the aim to significantly improve soil management knowledge and create a sustainable and integrated European soil research system. EJP SOIL involves more than 350 scientists across 24 Countries and has been addressing multiple aspects associated with soil management across different European agroecosystems. This study summarizes the key findings of stakeholder consultations conducted at the national level across 20 countries with the aim to identify important barriers and challenges currently affecting soil knowledge but also assess opportunities to overcome these obstacles. Our findings demonstrate that there is significant room for improvement in terms of knowledge production, dissemination and adoption. Among the most important barriers identified by consulted stakeholders are technical, political, social and economic obstacles, which strongly limit the development and full exploitation of the outcomes of soil research. The main soil challenge across consulted member states remains to improve soil organic matter and peat soil conservation while soil water storage capacity is a key challenge in Southern Europe. Findings from this study clearly suggest that going forward climate-smart sustainable soil management will benefit from (1) increases in research funding, (2) the maintenance and valorisation of long-term (field) experiments, (3) the creation of knowledge sharing networks and interlinked national and European infrastructures, and (4) the development of regionally-tailored soil management strategies. All the above-mentioned interventions can contribute to the creation of healthy, resilient and sustainable soil ecosystems across Europe.",This research was developed in the framework of the European Joint Program for SOIL âTowards climate-smart sustainable management of agricultural soilsâ (EJP SOIL) funded by the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant Agreement NÂ° 862695).

Knowledge sharing is a complex language-based activity; language affects how individuals communicate and relate. The growth in international collaborations and the increasing number of diverse teams affect knowledge sharing because individuals engage in daily knowledge activities in a language they are not native speakers. Understanding the challenges they face, and how they manage the emerging difficulties is the main aim of this manuscript. For this purpose, an explorative case study was conducted in an international university research project, namely the TED project. Both interviews and direct observations were employed to understand the phenomenon better and deliberately triangulate data and improve validity. Results show that non-native language use determines the emergence of different language proficiency, depending on the nature of the knowledge domain-job-related vs. non-job-related. Within non-job-related knowledge domains, the lack of linguistic abilities, summed to the perceived cultural diversities, mainly affects people's propensity to engage in personal and more intense social relationships. Under such circumstances, tacit knowledge sharing is reduced with negative consequences on the project's long-term innovative performance. Since the project is still running, detecting language challenges will allow the partners to design and apply effective measures to support cooperation with language and cultural barriers. Among them, code switching, adopted by ""bridge"" actors, already emerges as tool supporting communication and knowledge exchange.",,"TED project was the International Research Project âTEDâTeaching Digital Entrepreneurshipâ: Project funded by Erasmus + KA203 ProgramâPartnership Agreement No ERASMUS-PL-KA203-1/2020.

This includes the Covid-19 pandemic as well as more protracted crises such as climate change and persistent social inequalities that impact health. We sought to understand and compare how knowledge exchange (KE) processes occur across different crises, and how knowledge on improving social determinants of health can be utilised at times of crisis to reduce health inequalities and strengthen public systems.
METHODS: We conducted a scoping review to understand how KE on improving social determinants of health can occur across different types of crises (e.g. environmental, pandemics, humanitarian). Relevant studies were identified through electronic searching of Medline, EMBASE, Global Health, Scopus and Web of Science databases.
RESULTS: We identified 86 studies for inclusion in the review. Most studies concerned pandemic or environmental crises. Fewer studies explored KE during technical (e.g. nuclear), terror-related or humanitarian crises. This may reflect a limitation of the searches. Few studies assessed KE as part of longer-term responses to social and economic impacts of crises, with studies more likely to focus on immediate response or early recovery stages. Exchange of research evidence or data with policy or practice contextual knowledge was common but there was variation in the extent that lay (public) knowledge was included as part of KE processes.
CONCLUSION: As ongoing crises continue with significant public health implications, KE processes should appropriately reflect the complexity inherent in crises and foreground health inequalities.

Rational performance in the education system depends on the synergy of educators through knowledge sharing as the basis of education. The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge-sharing strategies in clinical education and its changes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The content analysis was conducted in 2019 at Birjand University of Medical Sciences. Twenty-seven clinical instructors with enough experience and knowledge in the field of clinical education were chosen based on purposive theoretical sampling. Data collection was done by semi-structured interviews, which continued until data saturation. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and read several times to obtain a whole understanding. Next, the meaning units and initial codes were identified, and then, they were classified into subcategories and categories. To ensure the trustworthiness of the data, Lincoln and Guba criteria were considered.
RESULTS: The results of the study include five pedagogical knowledge-sharing strategies: ""peer-helping, clinical education workplace,"" ""use of cyberspace,"" ""student mediation,"" ""working teams,"" and ""scientific communities."" Coronavirus pandemic was identified as the ""facilitator"" and the ""culturalization factor"" of knowledge sharing. In addition, ""lack of shared knowledge management,"" ""lack of compliance with needs,"" and ""dispersion of content"" were considered as barriers to the efficiency of pedagogical knowledge sharing during the coronavirus pandemic.
CONCLUSIONS: Sharing knowledge in a clinical education setting could continue by various strategies. The results can be used in planning for the professional development of professors.",The present article is a summary of the doctoral dissertation on curriculum planning at the Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences of Birjand University (code 1431210) and was done with the financial support of the National Strategic Research Center of Medical Education of Iran (code 970451).

According to the recent report âThe Open Innovation Barometerâ, released by the Economist, 90% of organizations have either adopted or are planning to implement key open innovation practices by opening up their organizational boundaries to collaborative innovation in the next three years (The Economist Group 2022). However, the social and economic changes imposed by the emerging processes of transition towards a more digital and sustainable society raise questions on how the open innovation field of studies is evolving to meet new, emerging needs. By combining bibliometric techniques and content analysis, this study illustrates how this research community has evolved in the last 12 years. More specifically, this study provides a descriptive analysis of the literature on open innovation, defines its knowledge structure, and illustrates a representative picture of the theoretical landscape. Our analysis shows that attempts to consolidate established topics and theoretical approaches in this field of studies go hand in hand with the emergence of new conversations about unexplored dimensions of open innovation.

The paper also strives to theoretically discuss and then seek empirical evidence to the mediational paths of psychological contract breach that explain the focal relationship between abusive supervision and knowledge hiding. To test the proposed hypotheses, the study draws cross-sectional data from sales force of insurance companies working in Pakistan. Data were collected through structured questionnaire and using convenient sampling technique. The final sample of 340 valid and complete responses analyzed using structured equation modeling (partial least square) approach. Results showed that abusive supervision is positively related to employee's knowledge hiding behaviors. Also, mediating variable psychological contract breach partially mediates the abusive supervision-knowledge hiding behavior linkage. Current study has tested the positive relationship between abusive supervision and knowledge hiding behaviors unlike most of the previous investigations that have focused on knowledge sharing behavior. The study also empirically investigated the mediational route of psychological contract breach, that explains the blame attributed by the beleaguered employee that led to covert retaliatory behavior, such as knowledge hiding.

In this knowledge era, HEIs are considered repositories of âknowledgeâ that are continuously reconfiguring and nurturing themselves with existing knowledge assets. Therefore, this study proposes a âdynamic IC transformationâ (I âP âO) model to analyze the relationship between intellectual capital (IC) initiatives as âknowledge inputsâ (I), âstrategic innovationâ and âprocess capabilitiesâ as âprocessorsâ (P), and the performance of HEIs as âknowledge-outputsâ (O). To test the model, we conducted a survey (questionnaire) involving 258 usable responses from teaching and non-teaching staff working in public and private HEIs in Pakistan. In this sense, we employed a parallel mediation analysis through process macro to evaluate the indirect effects of âprocessorsâ between âknowledge inputsâ and âknowledge output.â The study identifies that âknowledge inputsâ significantly influence the performance of HEIs in terms of âknowledge output.â However, the explanatory power of human capital as an essential element of IC initiatives is more detrimental than that of structural and relational capital initiatives. Further, results indicate that âprocessors,â i.e., âstrategic innovationâ and âprocess capabilities,â partially mediate the relationship between âknowledge inputsâ and âknowledge output.â Thus, this study contributes to ongoing academic debates about how the âdynamic IC transformation modelâ works in producing âknowledge outputsâ by leveraging âstrategic innovationâ and âprocess capabilitiesâ of HEIs. Further, this study also offers fruitful implications for academicians that may turn the IC initiatives as âknowledge inputsâ into the development of viable opportunities for HEIs as âentrepreneurialâ or âstakeholderâ universities by valuing their knowledge assets.",,,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,,,2023-03-28,2023,2023-03-28,,,,1-42,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Rehman, Wasim ul; Jalil, Faryal; Saltik, Omur; Degirmen, Suleyman; Bekmezci, Mustafa","Rehman, Wasim ul (Department of Business Administration, University of the Punjab, Gujranwala Campus, Gujranwala, Pakistan); Jalil, Faryal (Institute of Quality &Technology Management, University of the Punjab, Lahore, Pakistan); Saltik, Omur (Department of Economics, Konya Food and Agriculture University, Konya, Turkey); Degirmen, Suleyman (Department of Economics, Konya Food and Agriculture University, Konya, Turkey); Bekmezci, Mustafa (Department of Defense Studies, Turkish Military Academy, National Defense University, Istanbul, Turkey)","Rehman, Wasim ul (University of the Punjab)","Rehman, Wasim ul (University of the Punjab); Jalil, Faryal (University of the Punjab); Saltik, Omur (Konya Food and Agriculture University); Degirmen, Suleyman (Konya Food and Agriculture University); Bekmezci, Mustafa (National Defense University)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13132-023-01336-3.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156562100,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3803 Economic Theory,4 Quality Education

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Case series of medication route-related CDS malfunctions from diverse healthcare provider organizations.
RESULTS: Nine cases were identified and described, including both false-positive and false-negative alert scenarios. A common cause was the inclusion of nonsystemically available medication routes in value sets (eg, eye drops, ear drops, or topical preparations) when only systemically available routes were appropriate.
DISCUSSION: These value set errors are common, occur across healthcare provider organizations and electronic health record (EHR) systems, affect many different types of medications, and can impact the accuracy of CDS interventions. New knowledge management tools and processes for auditing existing value sets and supporting the creation of new value sets can mitigate many of these issues. Furthermore, value set issues can adversely affect other aspects of the EHR, such as quality reporting and population health management.
CONCLUSION: Value set issues related to medication routes are widespread and can lead to CDS malfunctions.

By utilizing social learning, we propose that servant leadership and perceived coworker support can reduce the knowledge hiding by enhancing the sense of organization-based psychological ownership. The findings of time-lagged and multi-source data indicate that servant leadership has a negative relationship with knowledge hiding. Our results also indicate that psychological ownership mediates the effects of servant leadership on knowledge hiding. Moreover, a higher level of perceived coworker support enhances the sense of psychological ownership which helps to reduce knowledge hiding. This research extends strong support for the proposition that servant leaders who adopt an employee-centered management approach, stressing personal integrity and care for employees significantly affect employee attitudes and behaviors. Moreover, this study suggests that managers should demonstrate care toward their subordinates which helps them to reduce negative behaviors (e.g., knowledge hiding).",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,2022-09-09,2022,2022-09-09,,13,,860405,All OA; Gold,Article,"Anwaar, Saima; Jingwei, Liu","Anwaar, Saima (Marxism College of Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China; Heilongjiang Provincial Think Tank for Ecological Civilization Construction and Green Development, Harbin, China); Jingwei, Liu (Marxism College of Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China; Marxism College of Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting and Finance, Shanghai, China)","Jingwei, Liu (Northeast Forestry University; Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting and Finance)","Anwaar, Saima (Northeast Forestry University); Jingwei, Liu (Northeast Forestry University; Shanghai Lixin University of Accounting and Finance)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.860405/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150884715,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,

However, research processes often limit data collection to particular organizational levels or disseminate results to specific audiences. Decision-making that emerges can fail to account for the contrasting perspectives and needs of managers at each organizational level. The Ghana Health Service (GHS) addressed this problem with a multilevel and sequential research and action approach that has provided two decades of implementation learning for guiding community-based primary health care development.
METHOD: The GHS implementation research initiatives progressed from (i) a participatory pilot investigation to (ii) an experimental trial of strategies that emerged to (iii) replication research for testing scale-up, culminating in (iv) evidence-based scale-up of a national community-based primary health care program. A reform process subsequently repeated this sequence in a manner that involved stakeholders at the community, sub-district, district, and regional levels of the system. The conduct, interpretation, and dissemination of results that emerged comprised a strategy for achieving systems learning by conducting investigations in phases in conjunction with bottom-up knowledge capture, lateral exchanges for fostering peer learning at each system level, and top-down processes for communicating results as policy. Continuous accumulation of qualitative data on stakeholder reactions to operations at each organizational level was conducted in conjunction with quantitative monitoring of field operations.
RESULTS: Implementation policies were enhanced by results associated with each phase. A quasi-experiment for testing the reform process showed that scale-up of community-based primary health care was accelerated, leading to improvements in childhood survival and reduced fertility.
CONCLUSION: Challenges to system learning were overcome despite severe resource constraints. The integration of knowledge generation with ongoing management processes institutionalized learning for achieving evidence-driven program action.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This article was prepared as an activity of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation&#x27;s (DDCF) African Health Initiative.

Specifically, drawing upon the appraisal theory of empathy, we develop a moderated mediation model of empathy linking ICT use intensity and knowledge hiding. The hypothesized model is tested by conducting a scenario-based experimental study (Study 1, Nâ=â194) and a multi-wave field study (Study 2, Nâ=â350). Results show that ICT use intensity is positively related to employeesâ knowledge hiding through the mediating role of their empathy. Moreover, competitive goal interdependence strengthens the negative relationship between ICT use intensity and employeesâ empathy, and the indirect positive effect between ICT use intensity and employeesâ knowledge hiding. Overall, the research answers the questions of how and when ICT use intensity may influence employeesâ knowledge hiding.

In such organizational crises, employees tend to experience a loss or lack of resources, and they are more likely to engage in knowledge hiding to maintain their resources and competitive advantage. Knowledge hiding has often caused significant adverse consequences, and the research on knowledge hiding is limited. Drawing upon the Conservation of Resources and Transformational Leadership theories, a conceptual framework was developed to examine knowledge hiding behavior and its antecedents and consequences. We collected data from 281 Vietnamese employees working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results show that role conflict, job insecurity, and cynicism positively impact knowledge hiding behavior. Knowledge hiding behavior negatively affects job performance and mediates the antecedents of knowledge hiding on job performance.

1367,pub.1125092333,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104087,32126509,,Healthcare pathway discovery and probabilistic machine learning,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Healthcare pathways define the execution sequence of clinical activities as patients move through a treatment process, and they are critical for maintaining quality of care. The aim of this study is to combine healthcare pathway discovery with predictive models of individualized recovery times. The pathway discovery has a particular emphasis on producing pathway models that are easy to interpret for clinicians without a sufficient background in process mining. The predictive model takes the stochastic volatility of pathway performance indicators into account.
METHOD: This study utilizes the business process-mining software ProM to design a process mining pipeline for healthcare pathway discovery and enrichment using hospital records. The efficacy of combining learned healthcare pathways with probabilistic machine learning models is demonstrated via a case study that applies the proposed process mining pipeline to discover appendicitis pathways from hospital records. Machine learning methodologies based on probabilistic programming are utilized to explore pathway features that influence patient recovery time.
RESULTS: The produced appendicitis pathway models are easy for clinical interpretation and provide an unbiased overview of patient movements through the treatment process. Analysis of the discovered pathway model enables reasons for longer than usual treatment times to be explored and deviations from standard treatment pathways to be identified. A probabilistic regression model that estimates patient recovery time based on the information extracted by the process mining pipeline is developed and has the potential to be very useful for hospital scheduling purposes.
CONCLUSION: This study establishes the application of the business process modelling tool ProM for the improvement of healthcare pathway mining methods. The proposed pipeline for healthcare pathway discovery has the potential to support the development of probabilistic machine learning models to further relate healthcare pathways to performance indicators such as patient recovery time.",The authors like to thank Patrick Gladding and Ilze Ziedins for fruitful discussions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews, we conducted a scoping review of the literature reporting the use of CWAs during pandemics published between 2001 and 2021. Two reviewers undertook the screening, study selection and qualitative thematic analysis.
RESULTS: We identified a total of 46 studies. CWAs were used for the following two purposes: KT and KM (23 of 46) anddisease surveillance and infodemiology (20 of 46). Three studies addressed both purposes. Influenza was the focus of most studies (15 of 46), followed by COVID-19 (10 of 46).We identified and classified 24 barriers and 66 facilitators into four categories (factors related to the CWAs, users' knowledge and attitude towards CWAs, human environment, and organizational environment). We also found 74 positive and 7 negative effects that were classified into processes and outcomes.
CONCLUSION: CWAs offer the potential to accelerate KT and KM during pandemics. Their scalability and adaptability to different contexts makes them well suited to support the urgent KT and KM needed in the context of rapidly changing knowledge during pandemics.

While being primarily public health related, it has a tremendous impact on many other aspects, including business management. Many businesses were forced to introduce rapid changes to their business models in order to survive. The aim of this paper is to show the complexity and interrelations of changes triggered by COVIDâ19 outbreak. Understanding of this complexity is crucial for developing business resilience to similar events in the future. The paper uses systems thinking approach to analyze influence of COVIDâ19 pandemic on business operations and to show the importance of the proper government response to the COVIDâ19 crisis. A causal loop diagram is used to show the complicated mechanisms behind the impact of pandemic on several aspects of business operation and management. Perceptions of some variables play more important roles than actual variables, and it often requires more than one actor to solve a particular problem. Adaptive business management may prove to be a particular challenge for small business owners. The paper provides useful insights into the complex nature of contemporary business operation and management in the wake of a major epidemiological crisis. It may contribute to a better understanding of important factors that often tend to be disregarded and not paid enough attention to. It offers food for thought not only for academics, but also to business owners/managers, aware of the complexity of contemporary world and to governmentâlevel decisionâmakers.",,,Knowledge and Process Management,,,2021-06-22,2021,2021-06-22,2022-07,29,3,221-230,Closed,Article,"ZiÄba, Krzysztof","ZiÄba, Krzysztof (Faculty of Management and Economics, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland)","ZiÄba, Krzysztof (GdaÅsk University of Technology)","ZiÄba, Krzysztof (GdaÅsk University of Technology)",9,5,,8.37,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139037358,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

BACKGROUND: The increasing use of services in health and social care is a challenging aspect of modern telemedicine; it requires staff to develop relevant professional competence and good telemedicine practices.
METHODS: The study was conducted using thematic interviews of frontline leaders from primary health care, specialized medical care and social care (nâ=â10) in the spring of 2021. The data were analysed by inductive content analysis.
RESULTS: The following main categories were identified: Activities of frontline leaders while managing competence in telemedicine, promotion of community learning, competence management in determining telemedicine content, and recognizing health and social care professionals' competence in telemedicine.
CONCLUSIONS: Achieving the goals set for telemedicine requires ensuring that knowledge from leaders is widely disseminated and shared and that staff are adequately trained. The results can be utilized in the practical work of other telemedicine and in the development of their operations.

The Needs and Concerns of Healthcare Providers,"Given the expanding knowledge base in cancer genomics, risk-based screening is among the promising avenues to improve breast cancer (BC) prevention and early detection at the population level. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to explore the perceptions of healthcare professionals (HPs) regarding the implementation of such an approach and identify tools that can support HPs. After undertaking an in-depth thematic content analysis of the responses, 11 themes were identified. These were embedded into a logical model to distinguish the potential eligible participants (who?), the main clinical activities (how?) and associated tools (what?), the key factors of acceptability (which?), and the expected effects of the strategy (why?). Overall, it was found that the respondents positively welcomed the implementation of this strategy and agreed on some of the benefits that could accrue to women from tailored risk-based screening. Some important elements, however, deserve clarification. The results also highlight three main conditions that should be met to foster the acceptability of BC risk stratification: respecting the principle of equity, paying special attention to knowledge management, and rethinking human resources to capitalize on the strengths of the current workforce. Because the functioning of BC risk-based screening is not yet well defined, important planning work is required before advancing this organizational innovation, and outstanding issues must be resolved to get HPs on board.",The authors acknowledge all respondents for their valuable time and participation; and Kyriam Lachapelle (KL) for her support in data analysis.,"This research was supported through the PERSPECTIVE and PERSPECTIVE I&I research programs (The Government of Canada through Genome Canada and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (GPH-129344; GP1-155865), the MinistÃ¨re de lâÃconomie, de la Science et de lâInnovation du QuÃ©bec through Genome QuÃ©bec, and the QuÃ©bec Breast Cancer Foundation).

In sharing knowledge, they shared their experiences by freely publishing posts, testing cognition, and interacting and communicating. In knowledge capture, learners capture knowledge by viewing online courses, using social media to contact accounting practitioners, learning from othersâ experiences, and posting questions. In knowledge application, learners apply knowledge in examinations, internships, work guidance, error avoidance, and daily fund management. We also discovered that accounting practitioners and learners have different attitudes toward the issue of knowledge payment. We put forward suggestions for establishing accounting forums and groups on social media.

As the amount of health data increases, the number of isolated data silos is also expected to grow, limiting the accessibility of the collected data. Medical informatics is developing ways to move from siloed data to a more harmonized arrangement in information architectures. This paradigm shift will allow future research to integrate medical data at various levels and from various sources. Currently, comprehensive requirements engineering is working on data integration projects in both patient care- and research-oriented contexts, and it is significantly contributing to the success of such projects. In addition to various stakeholder-based methods, document-based requirement elicitation is a valid method for improving the scope and quality of requirements.
OBJECTIVE: Our main objective was to provide a general catalog of functional requirements for integrating medical data into knowledge management environments. We aimed to identify where integration projects intersect to derive consistent and representative functional requirements from the literature. On the basis of these findings, we identified which functional requirements for data integration exist in the literature and thus provide a general catalog of requirements.
METHODS: This work began by conducting a literature-based requirement elicitation based on a broad requirement engineering approach. Thus, in the first step, we performed a web-based systematic literature review to identify published articles that dealt with the requirements for medical data integration. We identified and analyzed the available literature by applying the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. In the second step, we screened the results for functional requirements using the requirements engineering method of document analysis and derived the requirements into a uniform requirement syntax. Finally, we classified the elicited requirements into a category scheme that represents the data life cycle.
RESULTS: Our 2-step requirements elicitation approach yielded 821 articles, of which 61 (7.4%) were included in the requirement elicitation process. There, we identified 220 requirements, which were covered by 314 references. We assigned the requirements to different data life cycle categories as follows: 25% (55/220) to data acquisition, 35.9% (79/220) to data processing, 12.7% (28/220) to data storage, 9.1% (20/220) to data analysis, 6.4% (14/220) to metadata management, 2.3% (5/220) to data lineage, 3.2% (7/220) to data traceability, and 5.5% (12/220) to data security.
CONCLUSIONS: The aim of this study was to present a cross-section of functional data integration-related requirements defined in the literature by other researchers. The aim was achieved with 220 distinct requirements from 61 publications. We concluded that scientific publications are, in principle, a reliable source of information for functional requirements with respect to medical data integration. Finally, we provide a broad catalog to support other scientists in the requirement elicitation phase.",This research was funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (grant 01ZZ1802T) and supported by an intramural grant from the Faculty of Medicine of Kiel University (âForschungsfÃ¶rderung 2021â).,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,,Humans; Knowledge Management; Publications; Data Collection; Systems Analysis; Information Storage and Retrieval,2023-02-09,2023,2023-02-09,,25,,e41344,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kinast, Benjamin; Ulrich, Hannes; Bergh, BjÃ¶rn; Schreiweis, BjÃ¶rn","Kinast, Benjamin (Institute for Medical Informatics and Statistics, Kiel University and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany); Ulrich, Hannes (Institute for Medical Informatics and Statistics, Kiel University and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany); Bergh, BjÃ¶rn (Institute for Medical Informatics and Statistics, Kiel University and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany); Schreiweis, BjÃ¶rn (Institute for Medical Informatics and Statistics, Kiel University and University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany)","Kinast, Benjamin (University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein)","Kinast, Benjamin (University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein); Ulrich, Hannes (University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein); Bergh, BjÃ¶rn (University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein); Schreiweis, BjÃ¶rn (University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein)",0,0,,,https://www.jmir.org/2023/1/e41344/PDF,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152848790,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

Healthcare providers are on the frontline in the struggle against this pandemic. In this regard, knowledge sharing is very crucial for healthcare professionals to provide safe, effective, and quality patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accurate and timely COVID-19 related knowledge helps for making evidence-based decisions, during the management of the pandemic. Therefore, this study aimed to assess COVID-19 related knowledge sharing practices and associated factors among healthcare providers who worked in COVID-19 treatment centers at specialized teaching hospitals in the Amhara Regional State, Northwest Ethiopia.
METHOD: An institutional-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from April 1 to May 30, 2021. The study included 476 healthcare providers who worked in COVID-19 treatment centers at specialized teaching hospitals in Northwest Ethiopia. A pretested and structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. EpiData 4.6 and SPSS version 23 were used for data entry and analysis respectively. Bi-variable and Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with the dependent variable. A P-value of less than 0.05 was used to declare statistical significance.
RESULT: A total of 454 respondents, with a response rate of 95.4%, were participated in the study. About, 55.3% (95% CI: 51-60.2) of healthcare providers had a good level of COVID-19 knowledge-sharing practice. Phone type [AORÂ =Â 4.05, 95% CI (1.99-8.25)], computer access [AORÂ =Â 2.09, 95% CI (1.12-3.92)], awareness [AORÂ =Â 2.01, 95% CI (1.20-3.39)], willingness [AORÂ =Â 1.77, 95% CI (1.05-2.97)] and educational status [AORÂ =Â 2.94, 95% CI (1.92-5.71)] were significantly associated with the COVID-19 knowledge sharing practices in the multivariable logistic regression model.
CONCLUSION: The finding implied that above half of the healthcare providers in this study setting were good at sharing their COVID-19 related knowledge. Policymakers, government, and other concerned bodies should stress to improve computer access, awareness creation, enhancing healthcare providers' willingness to share their COVID-19 related knowledge, introducing smartphone technology, and rising healthcare providers' educational status are necessary measures to improve COVID-19 related knowledge sharing practice in this study setting.","The authors are indebted to the University of Gondar College of medicine and health science&#x27;s ethical review board for the approval of ethical clearance and the Amhara region institute of public health and each hospital for giving a supporting letter.

Developing an effective CDSS is an arduous task that can take advantage from prior assessment of the most promising theories, techniques and methods used at the present time.
OBJECTIVE: To identify the features of Clinical Decision Support Systems and provide an analysis of their effectiveness. Thus, two research questions were formulated: RQ1-What are the most common trend characteristics in a CDSS? RQ2-What is the maturity level of the CDSS based on the decision-making theory proposed by Simon?
METHODS: AIS e-library, Decision Support Systems journal, Nature, PlosOne and PubMed were selected as information sources to conduct this systematic literature review. Studies from 2000 to 2020 were chosen covering search terms in CDSS, selected according to defined eligibility criteria. The data were extracted and managed in a worksheet, based on the defined criteria. PRISMA statements were used to report the systematic review.
RESULTS: The outcomes showed that rule-based module was the most used approach regarding knowledge management and representation. The most common technological feature adopted by the CDSS were the recommendations and suggestions. 19,23% of studies adopt the type of system as a web-based application, and 51,92% are standalone CDSS. Temporal evolution was also possible to visualize. This study contributed to the development of a Maturity Staging Model, where it was possible to verify that most CDSS do not exceed level 2 of maturity.
CONCLUSION: The trend characteristics addressed in the revised CDSS were identified, compared to the four predefined groups. A maturity stage model was developed based on Simon's decision-making theory, allowing to assess the level of maturity of the most common features of the CDSS. With the application of the model, it was noticed that the phases of choice and implementation are underrepresented. This constitutes the main gap in the development of an effective CDSS.",,"This study was supported by FCT â FundaÃ§Ã£o para a CiÃªncia e Tecnologia, within the scope of the project DSAIPA/DS/0084/2018, FH work was supported by the grant 2021.06230.BD.

The study focused on a relatively less explored area of how non-formal EE in the form of project-based learning and how it was used to equip the community with skills and knowledge. Using qualitative data collection methods and thematic analysis was employed as an analytical strategy, the study produced evidence of the importance of community programs to out-of-school youths and adults in the acquisition of fundamental skills and knowledge. Greening campaigns were found to be essential in sustaining the lives of the rural communities. As demonstrated in the study, community projects aimed at enhancing learning are in sync with theory of project-based learning. Assisted by relevant conceptualization, the organization which motivated this study, develops insights for knowledge management for further implementation strategies. Its major focus is on empowering poor communities and their institutions by ensuring environmental security and livelihoods. As crucial stakeholders, communities received knowledge and technical skills through experience sharing, training, and workshops. Findings further indicated that most of the project community members were illiterate prior to their engagement in the project activities, which demonstrated that they needed to acquire basic knowledge and skills enact agency. Many community members became part of the project because of the mobilization and awareness creation campaign by the local development organization. However, there have been several roadblocks to the implementation of the community projects. But most importantly the study shows, skills and knowledge imparted through EE were important to implement community projects, helping to enhance community participation in raising environmental quality, thereby improving environmental performance, farming methods, and livelihood situations. We suggest project-based learning be used as a tool for community empowerment initiatives aimed at responding to environmental problems.","The authors acknowledge the Faculty of Humanities for Research, Postgraduate and Community Services, Bahir Dar University, for providing financial support for the dissertation of the first author which provided empirical data for the article.

While there has been progress in strengthening multi-organizational networks on nutrition at country and global levels, the regional level has received much less attention. We conducted a study to 1) determine the existing relationships and levels of engagement between international organizations working to improve nutrition at the regional level or in at least two countries in South Asia; and 2) examine the experiences and perspectives of international organizations on regional-level communication, coordination or collaboration on nutrition in South Asia.MethodsÂ A mixed methods approach involving organizational network analysis (ONA) and semi-structured interviews was used to develop an understanding of the existing network and relationships between international organizations working on nutrition in South Asia. ONA data from 43 international organizations was analysed using a social network analysis software (UCINET) to systematically quantify and visualize the patterns of relationships between organizations.ResultsWe found a high degree of connectivity between most of the international organizations in South Asia, but there were gaps between the many organizations that knew each other and the work they did together regionally on nutrition. Most organizations worked together only ârarelyâ or âsometimesâ on nutrition at the regional level and high-intensity (collaborative) working relationships were uncommon. Organizations of the same type tended to cluster together, and a small number of UN agencies and multilateral organizations were central brokers in the nutrition working relationships. Perceived constraints to the nutrition working relationships included organizationsâ agenda and mandate, threats to visibility and branding, human and financial resources, history, trust and power relations with other organizations, absence of a regional network for cooperation, and donor expectations. There was high demand to remedy this situation and to put network mechanisms in place to strengthen communication, coordination and collaboration on nutrition.ConclusionsOpportunities are being missed for organizations to work together on nutrition at the regional level in South Asia. The effectiveness of regional nutrition networks in influencing policy or programme decisions and resources for nutrition at country level should be explored.",Not applicable.,"This work was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation through the Regional Initiatives for Sustained Improvements in Nutrition and Growth (grant INV-008600 to UNICEF).

For nurses, knowledge hiding behavior is not conducive to improving the quality and efficiency of their work and hinders the innovation of nursing services. Based on the social exchange theory, the current study constructed a moderated mediation model by taking psychological safety and felt obligation as mediating variables, and traditionality as moderating variable, and explored the mechanism of feeling trusted affecting knowledge hiding behavior. The empirical research based on 285 nurses from China shows that feeling trusted is negative correlate with knowledge hiding behavior; feeling trusted can negatively affect knowledge hiding by enhancing psychological safety and felt obligation; traditionality can positively moderate the relationship between feeling trusted and felt obligation, and feeling trusted has a stronger positive influence on felt obligation of highly traditional nurses; traditionality has no significant moderating effect between feeling trusted and psychological safety. Theoretically, this study supplements the influencing factors of knowledge hiding, examines the complex mechanism between feeling trusted and knowledge hiding and supplements the boundary conditions for feeling trusted to play its role from the perspective of individual characteristics (i.e., traditionality). From the perspective of practical implication, this study suggests that managers should pay attention to using trust strategies to enhance subordinates' psychological safety and felt obligation, especially for highly traditional nurses, thus reducing knowledge hiding.",,"This research was funded by the Research topic of Kaifeng philosophy and social science planning, grant number ZXSKGH-2022-1058, the Key Program of Research and Practice on Undergraduate Teaching Reform of Henan University, grant number HDXJJG2020-25, and the Survey Subject of Henan Federation of Social Sciences Circles: âResearch on the Status Quo and Cultivation Mechanism of Social and Emotional Abilities of Youth in Henan Provinceâ, grant number SKL-2022-55.",Frontiers in Psychology,,,2022-11-18,2022,2022-11-18,,13,,1034882,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lu, Guangli; Liang, Yipei; Ding, Yueming; Tang, Haishan; Zhang, Yiming; Huang, Haitao; Chen, Chaoran","Lu, Guangli (Institute of Business Administration, School of Business, Henan University, Kaifeng, China); Liang, Yipei (Institute of Business Administration, School of Business, Henan University, Kaifeng, China); Ding, Yueming (Institute of Nursing and Health, School of Nursing and Health, Henan University, Kaifeng, China); Tang, Haishan (Institute of Nursing and Health, School of Nursing and Health, Henan University, Kaifeng, China); Zhang, Yiming (Institute of Nursing and Health, School of Nursing and Health, Henan University, Kaifeng, China); Huang, Haitao (Institute of Nursing and Health, School of Nursing and Health, Henan University, Kaifeng, China); Chen, Chaoran (Institute of Nursing and Health, School of Nursing and Health, Henan University, Kaifeng, China)","Lu, Guangli (Henan University); Liang, Yipei (Henan University); Chen, Chaoran (Henan University)","Lu, Guangli (Henan University); Liang, Yipei (Henan University); Ding, Yueming (Henan University); Tang, Haishan (Henan University); Zhang, Yiming (Henan University); Huang, Haitao (Henan University); Chen, Chaoran (Henan University)",0,0,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1034882/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152863082,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,

Given the advantages of knowledge graph technology and the fact that most recommendation models fail to make full use of the correlation between knowledge graph and recommended items, this paper proposes a cross-attention fusion-based knowledge graph recommendation algorithm (CAKR). The CAKR model contains a cross-fusion module, a recommendation task module, and a knowledge graph embedding task module, and the inputs of the two task modules are alternately learned in a low-dimensional space by the cross-fusion module. The input of the two task modules is alternately learned in the low-dimensional space by the cross-fusion module to interact with the two embedding vectors of items and entities, and then, the obtained feature vectors are fed into the relevant task modules, respectively, and then, the results are calculated by the respective prediction functions. There is a mediating role of knowledge management capabilities in the innovation ecology perspective between social capital and innovation performance of SMEs. Among them, it fully mediates the relationship dimension of technical social capital, the cognitive dimension of institutional social capital, the relationship and cognitive dimension of market-based social capital, and innovation performance, and partially mediates the structural and cognitive dimension of technical social capital, the structural and relationship dimension of institutional social capital, and innovation performance. The relationship between knowledge management capability and innovation performance is positively mediated by environmental dynamics in the innovation ecology perspective, and the positive effect of knowledge management capability on innovation performance is more significant when the environmental dynamics are stronger, and vice versa. Finally, based on the results of the empirical study, some management suggestions are provided on how SMEs can reasonably utilize social capital to enhance their innovation performance.","This work was supported by research results of Jiangsu Social Science Fund Project âResearch on the Mechanism of Government Governance and Social Capital on Technological Innovation Quality,â 20EYD003.",,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,Knowledge; Learning; Social Capital,2022-06-06,2022,2022-06-06,2022-06-06,2022,,2138200,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ding, Yuanyi","Ding, Yuanyi (Nanjing Audit University, Nanjing, Jiangsu 211815, China, nau.edu.cn)","Ding, Yuanyi (Nanjing Audit University)","Ding, Yuanyi (Nanjing Audit University)",0,0,,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2022/2138200.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148459186,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

In line with both knowledge economy and financial literature, the paper aims to indagate the relationship between agency costs, firmâs performance, and delisting. Despite there is evidence in finance that highlights the role of exchange regulators in the going private processes, just few studies focus on the voluntary delisting and its antecedents. Starting from the knowledge economy setting, this paper aims to define how firmâs financial performance moderates the relationship between agency costs and delisting choices. Based on a sample of non-financial firms delisted from the most important European stock markets between 1997 and 2017, we applied an OLS regression to analyze the main variables that influence the going private processes. We find that a high level of stock market performance, associated with high level of free cash flows, promotes going private as a means of anticipating and preventing future value decreases.

Based on the social exchange theory, the present study assumes that a PCB negatively affects a firm's innovative performance. The present study also assessed the mediating role of knowledge hiding (KH) and moral disengagement (MD) in the relationship between PCB and a firm's innovative performance. This study also attempts to check the moderating role of perceived supervisor support (PSS) in the relationship between PCB and KH and between PCB and MD. For empirical investigation, the present study collected the data from 303 employees of various textile organizations in china through a structured questionnaire method using a convenient sampling technique. The present study applied partial least square structural equation modeling for empirical analyses using Smart PLS software. The present study revealed that a PCB does not directly influence a firm's innovative performance. However, the results confirmed that KH negatively mediates the relationship between PCB and a firm's innovative performance. On the other hand, results also confirmed that MD negatively mediates the relationship between PCB and a firm's innovative performance. The finding also acknowledged that the PSS does not moderate the relationship between PCB and KH. Additionally, the findings confirmed that PSS positively moderates the relationship between PCB and moral disengagement.

However, safety statistics have reached a plateau and actions for further improvement of OHS management systems are called for. OHS is a form of organizational expertise that has both tacit and explicit dimensions and is situated in the ongoing practices. There is a need for institutionalization and for the transfer of knowledge across and along construction supply chains to reduce OHS risks and facilitate cultural change. The focus of this article is the factors that facilitate OHS knowledge transfer in and between organizations involved in construction projects. An interpretative methodology is used in this research to embrace tacit aspects of knowledge transfer and application. Thematic analysis is supported by a cognitive mapping technique that allows understanding of interrelationships among the concepts expressed by the respondents. This paper demonstrates inconsistency in OHS practices in construction organizations and highlights the importance of cultivating a positive safety culture to encourage transfer of lessons learnt from good practices, incidents, near misses and failures between projects, from projects to programmes and across supply chains. Governmental health and safety regulations, norms and guidelines do not include all possible safety issues specific to different working environments and tied to work contexts. The OHS system should encourage employees to report near misses, incidents and failures in a 'no-blame' context and to take appropriate actions. This research provides foundation for construction project practitioners to adopt more socially oriented approaches towards promoting learning-rich organizational contexts to overcome variation in the OHS and move beyond the current plateau reached in safety statistics.","This study is part of wider research, funded by HKU-UCL Strategic Partnership Fund, which is linked to UCLâs Grand Challenges.",,Accident Analysis & Prevention,,"Accident Prevention; Accidents, Occupational; Construction Industry; Humans; Occupational Health; Organizational Culture; Qualitative Research",2020-03-18,2020,2020-03-18,2020-05,139,,105496,All OA; Green,Article,"Duryan, Meri; Smyth, Hedley; Roberts, Aeli; Rowlinson, Steve; Sherratt, Fred","Duryan, Meri (The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London, London, United Kingdom); Smyth, Hedley (The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London, London, United Kingdom); Roberts, Aeli (The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, University College London, London, United Kingdom); Rowlinson, Steve (Real Estate and Construction, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong); Sherratt, Fred (School of Engineering and the Built Environment, Anglia Ruskin University, Chelmsford, United Kingdom)","Duryan, Meri (University College London)","Duryan, Meri (University College London); Smyth, Hedley (University College London); Roberts, Aeli (University College London); Rowlinson, Steve (University of Hong Kong); Sherratt, Fred (Anglia Ruskin University)",41,29,2.34,26.21,https://arro.anglia.ac.uk/id/eprint/705311/6/Duryan_et_al_2020.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125733269,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

OBJECTIVES: To use Social Network Analysis (SNA) to confirm or reject the hypothesis that psychiatric professionals have equal status in sharing information and advice on the care of PWA and have reciprocal ties in a social network.
METHODS: The sample consisting of 50 psychiatric professionals working in geriatric psychiatry in the UK completed an anonymous online survey asking them to select the professional categories of the colleagues in the interprofessional team who are most frequently approached when providing or receiving advice about patient care and gathering patient information. SNA is both a descriptive qualitative analysis and a quantitative method that investigates the degree of the prestige of professionals in their working network, the reciprocity of their ties with other team members, and knowledge management.
RESULTS: The social network graphs and numerical outcomes showed that interprofessional teams in geriatric psychiatry have health carers who play central roles in providing the whole team with the knowledge necessary for patient care; these are primarily senior professionals in nursing and medical roles. However, the study reported that only 13% of professionals had reciprocal ties with knowledge sharing within teams.
CONCLUSION: The current research findings show that knowledge management in interprofessional teams caring for PWA is not evenly distributed. Those with apparently higher seniority and experience are more frequently consulted; however, other more peripheral figures can be equally valuable in integrated care.",Declared none.,,Current Alzheimer Research,,"Alzheimer Disease; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Humans; Information Dissemination; Internet; Interprofessional Relations; Patient Care Team; Psychiatry; Social Network Analysis; Surveys and Questionnaires",2021,2021,,2021,18,5,380-398,Closed,Article,"Lazzari, Carlo; Kotera, Yasuhiro; Green, Pauline; Rabottini, Marco","Lazzari, Carlo (International Centre for Healthcare and Medical Education, Bristol, United Kingdom, ;); Kotera, Yasuhiro (Department of Health and Social Care, University of Derby, Derby, United Kingdom, ;); Green, Pauline (Department of Health and Social Care, University of Derby, Derby, United Kingdom, ;); Rabottini, Marco (International Centre for Healthcare and Medical Education, Bristol, United Kingdom, ;)","Lazzari, Carlo ","Lazzari, Carlo (); Kotera, Yasuhiro (University of Derby); Green, Pauline (University of Derby); Rabottini, Marco ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139367552,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Furthermore, the fostering factors for knowledge sharing have also remained unexplored because the employees in an organization are unwilling to share their knowledge with others for several reasons. The current study has attempted to explore the reasons that make employees hide their knowledge from other employees in order to excel. The individual factors considered in this study that make employees hide their knowledge are the lack of rewards for knowledge sharing, internal competition, and psychological entitlement. Furthermore, the interesting consequent factor of knowledge hiding in this study was found to be significant. The moderating role of employees' social status has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between knowledge-hiding behavior and organizational performance. The population of the study was the managerial employees of financial institutions of China and the sample size taken in his study was 446 via convenient sampling technique. The independent factors in this study found significant results of knowledge-hiding behavior, thus approving the mediating role of knowledge hiding in the organizational performance of the financial institutions of China. The software used in this study for the data analysis was smart PLS and the technique used was partial least square SEM for the measurement of the hypothesis of the study. The study's findings also have certain implications for policymaking in financial institutions that may hinder knowledge hiding practices and support the uninterrupted flow of knowledge among employees.",,"This study was supported by Renmin University of China (RUC), China.",Frontiers in Psychology,,,2021-12-20,2021,2021-12-20,,12,,796976,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wen, Junqi; Ma, Ruijun","Wen, Junqi (School of Labor and Human Resources, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China; Beijing Docvit Law Firm, Tianjin, China); Ma, Ruijun (School of Labor and Human Resources, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China)","Ma, Ruijun (Renmin University of China)","Wen, Junqi (Renmin University of China); Ma, Ruijun (Renmin University of China)",7,7,1.85,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.796976/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144031155,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,

More recently, computerized CBT (CCBT) has been deployed to help increase availability and access to this evidence-based therapy. In this vein, a CBT ontology, as a shared common understanding of the domain, can facilitate the aggregation, verification, and operationalization of computerized CBT knowledge. Moreover, as opposed to black-box applications, ontology-enabled systems allow recommended, evidence-based treatment interventions to be traced back to the corresponding psychological concepts. We used a Knowledge Management approach to synthesize and computerize CBT knowledge from multiple sources into a CBT ontology, which allows generating personalized action plans for treating mild depression, using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL).

However, little is known about the impact of the information management process (IMP) on organizations' digital green innovation. To address this gap, we devised a multidimensional framework based on the resource-based view (RBV) theory that serves as a basis for sculpting how the IMP captured and sustained organizational digital green innovation via SDPCs. 533 respondents from big and medium-sized manufacturing businesses in China were surveyed, and data were analyzed using the structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. The study makes numerous significant findings. Firstly, the SDPC's dimensions (environment, economic, and social) are considerably improved by the IMP' dimensions (acquisition, dissemination, and application). Secondly, SDPC's dimensions are critical for attaining organizations' digital green innovation. Thirdly, SDPCs' implementation mediates the linkage between the IMP and organizations' digital green innovation. Our findings suggest that investing in and implementing cutting-edge technology and sustainable practices are critical for long-term success. Still, soft issues, such as organizational information management, are equally critical in today's information-based economy.

As a part of SASHA, this research aimed to develop evidence-based and context-aware policy options for increasing the capacity of decision-makers to apply EIHP in Iran.
METHODS: This was a qualitative study, which was informed by a literature review of pull efforts' capacity building programs. Based on the review, we developed policy options and validated them through an expert panel that involved twelve experts. Data were analyzed using a content analysis method.
RESULTS: We extracted data from 11 articles. The objectives of capacity building programs were: single-skill development, personal/professional development, and organizational development. According to these objectives, the contents and training methods of the programs vary. Capacity building programs have shown positive impacts on individual knowledge/attitudes to use EIHP. However, the impacts of programs at the organizational or the health system level remain under-researched. We followed several threads from the literature review through to the expert panel that included training the management team, instead of training managers, training for problem-solving skills, and designing tailored programs. Barriers of capacity building for EIHP regard the context of the health system (weak accountability and the widespread conflict of interest) and healthcare organizational structures (decision support systems, knowledge management infrastructures, and lack of management team). Experts suggested interventions on the barriers, particularly on resolving the conflict of interests before launching new programs. A proposed framework to increase the capacity of health policy-makers incorporates strategies at three levels: capacity building program, organizational structure, and health system context.
CONCLUSION: To prepare the context of Iranian healthcare organizations for capacity building programs, the conflict of interests needs to be resolved, decision-makers should be made more accountable, and healthcare organizations need to provide more knowledge management infrastructures and decision support systems.",,"This work was supported by the Deputy for Research and Technology at the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education (Grant Number 700.1953) and Iranian National Institute for Medical Research Development (NIMAD) (Grant Number 958431).

METHOD: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 participants of varying roles and experience (i.e., students, culinary instructors, and restaurant chefs) in the culinary and hospitality arts program at a large polytechnic in western Canada.
RESULTS: The emergent themes from these interviews indicated that the circulation of safety knowledge relied on the interaction among individuals with various levels of experience, such that those who were more experienced in the culinary arts were able to share safety knowledge with novices, who had less experience. Comparing safety knowledge gleaned from within the school against that gleaned from within the industry highlighted differences between the construction of safety in the two contexts. Notably, many aspects of safety knowledge are not learned in school and those that are may not apply in the industry context. We found that safety knowledge was shared through informal means such as storytelling, a process that allowed members to come to a deep, collective understanding of what safety meant, which they often labeled ""common sense.""
CONCLUSION: We found that safety knowledge was a currency through which participants achieved legitimacy, generated through continual practical accomplishment of the work in interaction with others.

Exploring Differences in Construction Safety Perception of Two Key Field Stakeholders,"Persisting high rates of worksite accidents and injuries in construction projects indicate the urge to investigate the root causes and revisit safety practices in this industry. Consonance in perceptions and safety approaches has been identified as a fundamental factor in boosting projects' safety. Discrepancies between how different elements of construction safety are perceived and handled by the key stakeholders, namely managers and workers, could be detrimental to worksite safety. This research studied how, if at all, the perception of four key construction safety components, including 33 sets of pairwise questions, is different in the lens of managers from workers. To explore safety perceptions, 133 construction professionals in the United States participated in the study and expressed their perceptions toward their own and counterparts' (1) safety knowledge, (2) safety culture and commitment, (3) safety performance, and (4) safety support and communication. The results indicated that massive gaps in safety perceptions do exist between the construction managers and workers (26 out of 33 areas), and the magnitude varies for different safety elements. In all four categories, both managers and workers perceived a superior safety position for themselves and inferior for their counterparts. Further investigations revealed that the common ground between managers and workers is their consensus on proper communication and safety training as the key solutions to address such discrepancies. Construction safety professionals and practitioners can benefit from the results of this study to establish and implement strategies to foster communication and provide more effective safety training to bridge the existing gaps in the perception of safety by managers and workers.",The authors would like to appreciate those industry experts who participated in this study and helped with their valuable opinions.,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Causality; Humans; Occupational Health; Perception; Safety Management; United States; Workplace,2022-05-19,2022,2022-05-19,,19,10,6172,All OA; Gold,Article,"Namian, Mostafa; Tafazzoli, Mohammadsoroush; Al-Bayati, Ahmed Jalil; Kermanshachi, Sharareh","Namian, Mostafa (Department of Construction Management, College of Engineering and Technology, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27858, USA); Tafazzoli, Mohammadsoroush (School of Design and Construction, Voiland College of Engineering and Architecture, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164, USA;, tommy.tafazzoli@wsu.edu); Al-Bayati, Ahmed Jalil (Department of Civil and Architectural Engineering, Lawrence Technological University, Southfield, MI 48075, USA;, aalbayati@ltu.edu); Kermanshachi, Sharareh (Department of Civil Engineering, College of Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX 76019, USA;, sharareh.kermanshachi@uta.edu)","Namian, Mostafa (East Carolina University)","Namian, Mostafa (East Carolina University); Tafazzoli, Mohammadsoroush (Washington State University); Al-Bayati, Ahmed Jalil (Lawrence Technological University); Kermanshachi, Sharareh (The University of Texas at Arlington)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/10/6172/pdf?version=1652955220,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148018237,"33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations",

        The rapidly escalating COVIDâ19 pandemic entails many unprecedented life circumstances, including in the way people work. The social distancing policy has forced companies to adopt workâfromâhome (WFH) arrangement to maintain business sustainability amidst both health and economic crises. While in many developed countries, WFH arrangement has been a common practice, this is not the case in some Asian countries, particularly in countries where high power distance emphasising heightened supervision and punishment among workers are still a preferred managerial style, such as Indonesia, China, India, and Thailand. While acknowledging that WFH is considered as beyond an option in this pandemic period, this commentary paper, built on existing literature presented in the narrative fashion, aims to critically identify key barriers of WFH implementation in some Asian countries, particularly in autocratic societies, using both theoretical and contextual approaches. The paper concludes by discussing recommendation for future studies and proposing strategic implications for companies and workers to effectively adopt WFH arrangement, especially in societies where WFH is still a new practice or is involuntarily held.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Open access publishing facilitated by The University of Queensland, as part of the Wiley â The University of Queensland agreement via the Council of Australian University Librarians.

BACKGROUND: Organisational learning is an active process needed for improving organisational performance, and silence has a devastating impact on an organisation's capacity to learn.
METHODS: A cross-sectional quantitative design was applied using two tools: the organisational silence and the organisational learning scales. Over 3Â months, data were collected from 724 nurses. The data were then analysed using suitable statistical methods.
RESULTS: The organisational silence level is moderate. The organisational learning level is predominantly moderate. The association between the two scales is a weak negative correlation, yet statistically significant. The multiple regression analysis was better in predicting organisational learning scores.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a highly statistically significant negative weak correlation between overall organisational silence and overall organisational learning. More researchers are invited to implement of interventions to promote speaking-up behaviours and organisational learning in nurses.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nurse managers and leaders can create a work atmosphere that encourages and promotes open communication among nurses and other health care team members, likewise, creating an environment conducive to translating experiences into organisational learning.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Our deepest thanks to the hospital director and first level nurse managers of clinical units at Alexandria Main University Hospital for their assistance and encouragement.

This paper describes the characteristics of an infodemic, which combines an inordinately high volume of information (leading to problems relating to locating the information, storage capacity, ensuring quality, visibility and validity) and rapid output (making it hard to assess its value, manage the gatekeeping process, apply results, track its history, and leading to a waste of effort). This is bound up with the collateral growth of misinformation, disinformation and malinformation. Solutions to the problems posed by an infodemic will be sought in improved technology and changed social and regulatory frameworks. One solution could be a new trusted top-level domain for health information. The World Health Organization has so far made two unsuccessful attempts to create such a domain, but it is suggested this could be attempted again, in the light of the COVID-19 infodemic experience. The vital role of reliable information in public health should also be explicitly recognized in the Sustainable Development Goals, with explicit targets. All countries should develop knowledge preparedness plans for future emergencies.","Financial support. None declared.

Among them, SMEs (small and mediumâsized enterprises) tend to be more vulnerable. Characteristics such as scarcity of financial resources and lack of specialized knowledge make their situation even harder. This pandemic has resulted in increased digital transformation, changes in customer behavior and the managerial and technological knowledge gap to address them. Therefore, this article discusses the general weaknesses, strengths, challenges and opportunities for SMEs to face this pandemic, and how the field of knowledge management (KM) can help. Based on the concepts of organizational resilience, we drafted a conceptual model to illustrate how their first responses were and how they could become more adapted. First, we conducted a literature search to investigate how SMEs responded to this scenario. We found responses to the financial impacts in the form of mass layoffs, temporary and permanent closures, bootstrapping of digitalization and strategic alliances. In the discussions section, we raise some key questions to demonstrate how knowledge can improve the role of digital transformation. We approach how a KM strategy could start from organizational resilience concepts to assist SMEs to seize digital transformation opportunities. As practical implications, our research raises awareness of digital transformation's role as a set of tools to adapt during and after the pandemic, along with resilience engineering and knowledge management principles.

Additionally, in early 2020, the Association for Talent Development (ATD) globally launched their new Talent Development Capability Model. To determine how instructional design is operationalized in various industries, we utilized the Talent Development Capability Model as a framework to review 100 online job postings from LinkedIn, Indeed.com, and HigherEdJobs.com, scanning each for the 23 capabilities identified in the ATD Talent Development Capability Model. Using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) organizational framework as our method of reviewing job postings, we found that instructional design, talent delivery and facilitation, technology application, communication, and collaboration and leadership capabilities appeared the most frequently. Educational requirements were statistically significantly associated with job sectors, as shown in our analysis.

There is little research from an organizational perspective about how technology can help create a sustainable aging workforce.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to (1) explore how technological solutions in organizations can help create and maintain a healthy, productive, and capable aging workforce; and (2) provide recommendations and strategic guidance that benefit both the aging worker and the organization.
METHODS: International standardization practices, ethical frameworks, collaborative research, and use cases are used to demonstrate how technological solutions can be translated into practice and formed the basis for the development of a set of recommendations to create and maintain a sustainable aging workforce.
RESULTS: Organizations need to look at aging through different lenses to optimize an age-inclusive workforce rather than viewing it by chronological age alone. International standards in technology, human resources management, and aging societies can form part of the solution to improve aging workforces. Digitalization of workplaces, digital literacy, innovation, intergenerational collaboration, and knowledge management form important elements of the international standard on age-inclusive workforce. Using internationally agreed ethical frameworks that consider age bias when designing artificial intelligence-related products and services can help organizations in their approach. Age bias in artificial intelligence development in the workplace can be avoided through inclusive practices. No blockchain application was found yet to improve the aging workforce. Barriers to blockchain adoption include fear of layoffs, worker resistance and lack of blockchain competence, worldwide adoption, support, and funding. Integrating blockchain into the internet of things may allow for improved efficiencies, reduce cost, and resolve workforce capacity problems. Organizations could benefit from implementing or funding wearable technologies for their workers. Recent tools such as the Ageing@Work toolkit consisting of virtual user models and virtual workplace models allow for the adaptation of the work processes and the ergonomics of workplaces to the evolving needs of aging workers. Lastly, selected use cases that may contribute to sustaining an aging workforce are explored (eg, the Exposure-Documentation-System, wireless biomedical sensors, and digital voice notes).
CONCLUSIONS: The synergy of international standardization and ethical framework tools with research can advance information and communication technology solutions in improving aging workforces. There appears to be a momentum that technological solutions to achieve an age-inclusive workforce will undoubtedly find a stronger place within the global context and is most likely to have increased acceptance of technological applications among aging workers as well as organizations and governments. International standardization, cross-country research, and learning from use cases play an important role to ensure practical, efficient, and ethical implementation of technological solutions to contribute to a sustainable aging workforce.","We acknowledge Anne Livingstone (Executive Support and Chair of the National Home Care Group Aged Care Industry Technology Council (ACIITC]) for her support.

In order to explicitly identify the informal strategies followed by 49 farmers in their value-added ventures, we applied a theoretically informed business model framework combining three dimensions: value proposition linked to local food, customer engagement via quality schemes and shorter supply chains, and the key capabilities of the entrepreneur. Using cluster analysis, four different types of VCS were identified and labelled as 'Ecological', 'Single-product', 'Innovative', and 'Traditional'. Whilst we found that these strategies are influenced by contextual factors and the owner's entrepreneurial skills, in general, we did not observe significant differences in performance between them. The results suggest that farmers respond entrepreneurially to sectorial changes adopting those VCS that tend to align with their entrepreneurial capabilities and context, thus enabling them to succeed with any of the strategies pursued. Hence, our work contributes towards clarifying the relationship between VCS, entrepreneurial capabilities, and context. This is important for farmers and policymakers because it reveals the diversity of farm management and the resilience of farm systems.

But the market for business intelligence (BI) has evolved quickly. New opportunities like cloud computing have greatly lowered prices and eventually made it possible to design integrated solutions that are only intended for SMEs. In addition to highlighting the research trends in the sector under investigation, this paper explores the function of business intelligence in enhancing the decision-making process and competitive advantage of SMEs. The research subject has been approached using bibliometric analysis using the R package. The display of the results was done with the aid of Biblioshiny and VOSviewer's bibliometric tools.

However, adopting digital technologies is not easy due to barriers that may arise during this process. While prior literature offers initial insights into barriers at the firm level, these studies pay less attention to these barriers' multi-level nature. Focusing only on one particular level while ignoring others may not unleash the full potential of DTs in a circular economy. To overcome barriers, it's necessary to have a systemic understanding of the phenomenon, which is missing in previous literature. By combining a systematic literature review and multiple case studies of nine firms, this study aims to unpack the multi-level nature of barriers to a smart circular economy. The primary contribution of this study is a new theoretical framework composed of eight dimensions of barriers. Each dimension provides unique insights related to the multi-level nature of the smart circular economy transition. In total, 45 barriers were identified and categorized into the following dimensions: 1. Knowledge management (five barriers), 2. Financial (three barriers), 3. Process management & Governance (eight barriers), 4. Technological (ten barriers), 5. Product & Material (three barriers), 6. Reverse logistic infrastructure (four barriers), 7. Social behaviour (seven barriers), and 8. Policy & Regulatory (five barriers). This study examines how each dimension and multi-level barrier affects the transitions toward a smart circular economy. An effective transition copes with complex, multidimensional, multi-level barriers, which might require mobilization beyond a single firm. Government actions need to be more effective and correlated with sustainable initiatives. Policies also should focus on mitigating barriers. Overall, the study contributes to smart circular economy literature by increasing theoretical and empirical understanding of digital transformation barriers towards circularity.","The authors would like to acknowledge the SÃ£o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) â under the processes 2019/23655â9 and 2020/14462â0 â for supporting this research.

From July 2004 until June 2008 it was administered in a three-dose schedule to over a million individuals, aged six weeks to 20 years, to provide protection against the epidemic strain of group B Meningococci. The cost of the campaign, including the development of the vaccine was substantial, in excess of $200M, but it contributed to a reduced incidence of meningococcal infections along with a reduction in morbidity and mortality. The campaign led to the development of a national immunisation register (NIR), which is still in existence today. As well as considering the legacies of the MeNZB vaccination programme, this paper examines whether there are any lessons to be learned, specifically concerning active vaccine safety monitoring, which may be important if, and when, a COVID-19 vaccine is developed and a national immunisation campaign instituted.",,,The New Zealand Medical Journal,,"COVID-19; Drug Monitoring; Epidemiological Monitoring; Health Planning; Humans; Immunization Programs; Knowledge Management; Meningococcal Infections; Meningococcal Vaccines; Needs Assessment; Neisseria meningitidis, Serogroup B; New Zealand; Registries; SARS-CoV-2; Safety Management",2020-11-20,2020,2020-11-20,,133,1525,114-118,Closed,Article,"Reid, James Stewart","Reid, James Stewart (Retired, Waikanae.)",,"Reid, James Stewart ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132846063,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

The study specifically examined their knowledge of prescribing and counseling related to the care of women who present with complaints or clinical findings of genitourinary syndrome of menopause.
METHODS: An electronic questionnaire was distributed to healthcare providers involved in the care of women undergoing menopausal transition spanning a variety of medical specialties. The questionnaire was distributed to academic program directors, coordinators, and ListServ administrators to forward to targeted respondents. Items included demographic questions, clinical knowledge, management practices, and preferences. Statistical analysis for associations between demographics was performed using Chi-squared tests and between age groups with Kruskal Wallis tests.
RESULTS: The final sample contained 106 healthcare providers. Respondents were demographically diverse and encompassed multiple levels of professional training including Attendings, Trainees (Residents and Fellows), as well as Advanced Practice Registered Nurses. Significant differences were noted in many areas examined in our questionnaire, comprising knowledge, management, counseling, and prescribing practices surrounding the treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause when accounting for training level, specialty, and years in practice. Among all respondents, 10.4% reported rarely or never discussing menopausal symptoms with their patients. Most respondents (76.4%) stated they had prescribed topical therapies for genitourinary syndrome of menopause, with over 90% of practitioners prescribing lubricants/moisturizers and estradiol cream; however, only 55% reported being familiar with the US Food and Drug Administration's boxed warning on low-dose vaginal estrogen. Nearly half of the respondents (49%) reported being uncomfortable counseling about the boxed warning on low-dose vaginal estrogen.
CONCLUSION: This study identifies gaps in Mid-South healthcare providers' awareness of the boxed warning on low-dose vaginal estrogen as well as their comfort level in providing counseling regarding the risks, benefits, and alternatives to vaginal estrogen. Integrated practice between physicians and Advanced Practice Registered Nurses can lead to a significant benefit to patients experiencing menopause as shared experience and knowledge are shared between each group. Our survey does reveal gaps in knowledge and practice for optimal outcomes for patients experiencing genitourinary syndrome of menopause.

Knowledge hiding is an employee's intentional attempt to conceal knowledge requested by others at the workplace. Employee knowledge hiding significantly influences an organization's effective functioning. This research is an attempt to extend previous work on antecedents of knowledge hiding. Drawing on conservation of resources theory, it is proposed that receiving poor treatment by organizations in the form of organizational dehumanization creates psychological distress among employees toward the organization. Distress among workers in turn intervenes the path and increases the likelihood of engaging in knowledge hiding behaviors. An employee's felt obligation for constructive change (FOCC) may moderate the relationship between organizational dehumanization and employee psychological distress. Data for the current study were collected from 245 employees of the telecommunication sector in three-time lags. The results support the direct and indirect effect of organizational dehumanization on employee knowledge hiding behaviors through the mediation of psychological distress. The results also support the moderation of FOCC between organizational dehumanization and psychological distress. Furthermore, the findings of the study may help organizational practitioners and managers about the value of effective organizational climate and practices for better organizational functioning through knowledge sharing and providing insight into undesirable repercussions of organizational dehumanization.

This study aims to analyze the importance of organizational learning and the implications of applying its concepts in institutions of higher learning in KSA and occupational therapy education. We used secondary data obtained from a few studies that have assessed the adoption of learning organizations' concept in Saudi Arabian universities and occupational therapy educational programs and departments. The infrastructure has been improved to facilitate the adoption of the learning organizational concept under KSA's Vison 2030; however, a paradigm change is intensely needed where the adoption of the practice is acquired by faculty and staff members. Although organizational learning is essential for the survival and advancement of institutions of higher education as they are operating in a dynamic environment, it is hardly observed to be a part of the daily functioning in these organizations.

Furthermore, the secondary purpose is to examine the function of environmental uncertainty moderating the DCs-performance relationship. Concerning the analysis tool, this study employs topic modeling with Word2Vec embedding that analyzes unstructured data. This was employed as an alternative method beyond the limitations of the traditional approach, i.e., survey or interview. A DCs dictionary was constructed by redesigning the 12 detailed dimensions of Teece's DCs into 10 dimensions, and then time series scores of individual global companies were extracted by applying this dictionary to the sustainability reports of 97 companies. Sustainability reports of 153 companies among Fortune Global 500 companies announced in 2020 were originally collected, but in the process of collecting additional financial data about these companies from OSIRIS, a total of only 97 companies was selected in the end due to omission of data. A fixed effect panel analysis was conducted, and the main findings are as follows: First, the DCs embedded in ESG management have a positive or negative direct effect on corporate performance. In particular, a statistically significant relationship was not observed in the innovation (technology) oriented capabilities, whereas a statistically significant positive relationship was observed in the customer (market) oriented capabilities. Second, uncertainty moderates the relationship between DCs and corporate performance positively or negatively. Interestingly, the moderating effect of uncertainty only appears in the function of the sensing and reconfiguring capabilities. From this, it can be seen that the function of DCs, which is embedded in the ESG management of global companies, is limited due to the imbalance between the sensing-seizing-reconfiguring capabilities. These findings imply that, despite the positive function of DCs embedded in ESG management, costs and benefits occur at the same time, and DCs can improve performance only if there is an organizational adaptation strategy suitable for uncertainty. Accordingly, business managers need to recognize the importance of pursuing sensing-seizing-reconfiguring capabilities in a balanced way to improve corporate performance through ESG management under uncertainty.",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,2022-05-11,2022,2022-05-11,,13,,898935,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yang, Byung Mo; Yang, Oh Suk","Yang, Byung Mo (Department of Business Administration, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea); Yang, Oh Suk (Department of Business Administration, Kangwon National University, Chuncheon, South Korea)","Yang, Oh Suk (Kangwon National University)","Yang, Byung Mo (Kangwon National University); Yang, Oh Suk (Kangwon National University)",0,0,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.898935/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147773825,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,

Methods: The clinical case data of 120 AIDS patients who were treated and nursed in our hospital from June 2019 to June 2021 were selected as the research objects and were divided into the control group and the observation group according to the digital table method, with 60 cases each. The control group implements routine management, and the observation group implements case-based nursing management on this basis and compares the effects of self-efficacy, self-management ability, nursing ability, social support, and psychological flexibility of the two groups of patients.
Results: Before the intervention, the quality of life scores of the two groups was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). After the intervention, the physical function score, pain management score, and symptom response score of the observation group were significantly higher than those of the control group, and statistics showed that the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Before the intervention, the self-management ability of the two groups of patients was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). After the intervention, the observation group's symptom management, emotional cognition management, social support and assistance, daily life management, disease knowledge management, and treatment compliance management were significantly higher than those of the control group. Statistics show that this difference is statistically significant (P < 0.05). Before the intervention, there was no significant difference in the nursing ability and psychological flexibility between the two groups of patients (P > 0.05). After the intervention, the observation group's health knowledge level, self-care skills, self-care responsibility, self-concept, and mental flexibility (resilience, strength, optimism) indicators were higher than the control group, while the depression mood disorder score was significantly lower than the control group; statistics showed that this difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05).

The vastness of the scientific literature has been commonly blamed for this phenomenon, despite recent improvements in information retrieval and text mining. Its actual negative impact on scientific progress, however, has never been quantified. This analysis attempts to do so by exploring its effects on biomedical discovery, particularly in the discovery of relations between diseases, genes and chemical compounds. Results indicate that the probability that two scientific facts will enable the discovery of a new fact depends on how far apart these two facts were originally within the scientific landscape. In particular, the probability decreases exponentially with the citation distance. Thus, the direction of scientific progress is distorted based on the location in which each scientific fact is published, representing a path-dependent bias in which originally closely-located discoveries drive the sequence of future discoveries. To counter this bias, scientists should open the scope of their scientific work with modern information retrieval and extraction approaches.",Raul Rodriguez-Esteban received no funding for this work.,,PeerJ,,Data Mining; Publications; Biomedical Research; Knowledge,2022-01-10,2022,2022-01-10,,10,,e12764,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rodriguez-Esteban, Raul","Rodriguez-Esteban, Raul (Roche Pharmaceutical Research and Early Development, Roche Innovation Center Basel, Basel, Switzerland)","Rodriguez-Esteban, Raul (Roche (Switzerland))","Rodriguez-Esteban, Raul (Roche (Switzerland))",2,2,,,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.12764,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144579530,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5002 History and Philosophy Of Specific Fields,

Despite the available evidence, KMC adoption, implementation and scale-up has lagged. The purpose of this paper is to inform current and future KMC implementation by identifying achievements and challenges in countries that are in the process of scaling up KMC.
METHODS: We collected and analyzed information to track the status of facility-based KMC in countries identified by the KMC Acceleration Partnership. We assessed the status of the scale-up in six priority countries (Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria and Rwanda in Africa, and Bangladesh and India in Asia) for three periods: 2014 and prior, 2015-2017 and 2017-2019 across six strategic areas: national policy, country implementation, research, knowledge management, monitoring and evaluation and advocacy. We collected information through in-depth interviews with key participants, quantitative data extraction from the Demographic Health Survey and secondary data extraction from policies, briefs, program reports and other documents.
RESULTS: Progress in terms of national policy and advocacy appeared to occur quite quickly and evenly across the six priority countries, despite being at different stages during the first assessment. In the areas of country implementation support and research, progress occurred more slowly and results were more variable across countries. It was noted that the number of health facilities offering KMC services increased in all six priority countries, but coverage of KMC was difficult to estimate, demonstrating the ongoing challenges in the area of monitoring and evaluation despite progress made in integrating KMC indicators into national health information systems in five countries. Among the six priority countries - Malawi and Bangladesh had fully achieved at least four the first time six conditions were introduced.
CONCLUSIONS: We documented notable achievements in the dimensions of policy and country implementation across the six countries, which were likely driven by government engagement to prioritize newborn care services and the promotion of KMC as a core intervention for small babies. We noted challenges in critical areas such as ambulatory KMC, follow-up, and monitoring and evaluation. Addressing these gaps while securing funding to allocate human resources adequately, promoting acceptance of KMC for demand creation and facilitating the use of data for decision making will be vital to ensure effective coverage at scale.",We acknowledge the contributions of all the individuals who participated in the interviews and filled out the questionnaires.

However, the existing deficiency in the literature to show empirical relationships between knowledge transfer, from these SMEs and their international business partners, and innovation performance is a significant gap in the strategic management and international business literature. Therefore, this paper explores the link between knowledge transfer and innovation performance of informal economy SMEs that are involved in international business relationships. The study included a survey of 370 owners-managers and managers of small and medium enterprises in Nigeria's informal electronic market. Using Structural Equation Model (AMOS 22) this study shows that knowledge transfer dimensions, such as R&D and social networking, have varying levels of impact on innovation performance of informal sector SMEs. Knowledge transfer from training showed an inverse and insignificant relationship with innovation performance.

Digital forensic practitioners currently search for information and solutions in an ad hoc manner, leading to results that are unstructured, unverified, and sometimes incomplete. As a result, certain digital evidence is being missed or misinterpreted.

The effect of these changes on the organization of medical knowledge and the sharing of information remains largely unexplored. Recent work in social epistemology and the conceptualizing of implantable medical device companies as part of a knowledge-based industry provide a framework for engaging with this issue. In this article, we argue that the insertion of industry technicians into hospitals diminishes epistemically valuable knowledge-sharing practices. This is in part a result of health care professionals' increased dependence on IEAPs, who control access to knowledge about devices, limiting opportunities both for independent learning and for dialogic education practices through which participants work toward a common goal. Ultimately, we claim that overdependence on the IEAP as expert undermines a basic social value regarding knowledge sharing for everyone's benefit.",,,The Hastings Center Report,,Health Personnel; Humans; Knowledge,2022-03,2022,2022-04-27,2022-03,52,2,41-48,Closed,Article,"Howard, Mark; Hutchinson, Katrina","Howard, Mark (); Hutchinson, Katrina ()",,"Howard, Mark (); Hutchinson, Katrina ()",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147383393,50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics,

Hence, this study aimed at presenting a model of knowledge implementation in health system management in Iran.MethodsThe present two-phase study was first performed qualitatively using a directive content analysis approach based on the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (PARIHS) model. The researchers extracted the barriers and facilitators by conducting semi-structured individual interviews. Then, in a three-stage Delphi study, 25 health experts determined the barrier removal strategies. Data were analysed using MAXQDA10 software.ResultsÂ The content analysis of the interviews led to the emergence of 1212 codes under three categories of evidence, context and facilitation. The findings indicate that health managers make fewer decisions based on research findings. Instead, they make decisions regarding the experiences of service providers and organization data. In addition to the subcategories in the PARIHS model, the researchers extracted political, social and administrative factors under the context category. The relationships between the features of evidence, context, facilitation, barriers and strategies were presented in the final model.ConclusionÂ The presented model comprehensively emphasizes the evidence resources, context preparation, and facilitation of the knowledge implementation process.","The authors acknowledge the efforts made by experts and specialists for sharing their experiences and knowledge in the qualitative phase and all patients and health providers for participating in the quantitative phase and the technical support made by the Hospital Administration Research Centre of Islamic Azad University, Sari Branch.","There was no financial support in the design of the study, data collection, analysis and interpretation of results and writing of the manuscript.",Health Research Policy and Systems,,Health Services; Health Services Research; Humans; Iran; Knowledge; Qualitative Research,2022-06-16,2022,2022-06-16,,20,1,66,All OA; Gold,Article,"Roohi, Ghanbar; Jahani, Mohammad Ali; Farhadi, Zeynab; Mahmoudi, Ghahraman","Roohi, Ghanbar (Healthcare Services Management, School of Nursing and Midwifery, Golestan University of Medical Sciences, Gorgan, Iran); Jahani, Mohammad Ali (Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Health Research Institute, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran); Farhadi, Zeynab (Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Health Research Institute, Babol University of Medical Sciences, Babol, Iran); Mahmoudi, Ghahraman (Hospital Administration Research Center, Sari Branch, Islamic Azad University, Sari, Iran)","Mahmoudi, Ghahraman (Islamic Azad University Sari Branch)","Roohi, Ghanbar (Golestan University of Medical Sciences); Jahani, Mohammad Ali (Babol University of Medical Sciences); Farhadi, Zeynab (Babol University of Medical Sciences); Mahmoudi, Ghahraman (Islamic Azad University Sari Branch)",0,0,,,https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12961-022-00874-7,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148739607,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,

They improve adherence to evidence-based medicine and reduce medical errors.   Material and methods We have developed an advanced CDSS with the following components: 1. Knowledge Management System, which allows the introduction of interoperable clinical variables organized in taxonomies, and the generation, validation and direct maintenance of decision rules by experts doctors. 2. Smart Assistant for Medical Reports Generation, which facilitates user interaction for the introduction of clinical data (natural language and/or data entry forms) and decission making supported by real-time suggestions that are automatically generated by 3. Inference Engine. Rules and variables derived from the most relevant cardiovascular Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) are introduced by cardiologists into the system. The rules undergo a process of peer review and internal and external validation with anonymized clinical cases.   Results More than 2,000 clinical variables and more than 5,000 rules corresponding to more than 80 CPGs and consensuns papers have been created and validated. An internal and external pilot validation of the system has been successfully carried out for the main cardiovascular problems, such as heart failure, atrial fibrillation, valvulopathies, coronary syndromes, cardiomyopathies, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidaemias, using more than 400 cases.   Conclusion Our CDSS is capable of providing real-time diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for complex scenarios in cardiovascular disease, combining thousands of variables and decision rules in a single system. Prospective evaluation of the system in real clinical environments, certification and integration in Electronic Medical Records for clinical use is required.

To better capture users' preferences, some sequential recommendation models propose time-aware attention networks to capture users' long-term and short-term intentions. However, although these models have achieved good results, they ignore the influence of users on the rating information of items. We believe that in the sequential recommendation, the user's displayed feedback (rating) on an item reflects the user's preference for the item, which directly affects the user's choice of the next item to a certain extent. In different periods of sequential recommendation, the user's rating of the item reflects the change in the user's preference. In this paper, we separately model the time interval of items in the user's interaction sequence and the ratings of the items in the interaction sequence to obtain temporal context and rating context, respectively. Finally, we exploit the self-attention mechanism to capture the impact of temporal context and rating context on users' preferences to predict items that users would click next. Experiments on three public benchmark datasets show that our proposed model (SATRAC) outperforms several state-of-the-art methods. The Hit@10 value of the SATRAC model on the three datasets (Movies-1M, Amazon-Movies, Amazon-CDs) increased by 0.73%, 2.73%, and 1.36%, and the NDCG@10 value increased by 5.90%, 3.47%, and 4.59%, respectively.","The study was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 61772295, 61572270, and 61173056), the Science and Technology Research Program of Chongqing Municipal Education Commission (Grant no.

Partnerships offer opportunities to create synergistic outcomes by capitalizing on complimentary skills, knowledge and resources. Despite the importance of understanding partnership functioning, research on collaboration is sparse and fragmented, with few conceptual frameworks applied to evaluate real-life partnerships in global health. In this study, we aimed to adapt and apply the Bergan Model of Collaborative Functioning (BMCF) to analyse partnership functioning in the UK Public Health Rapid Support Team (UK-PHRST), a government-academic partnership, dedicated to outbreak response and research in low- and middle-income countries. We conducted a literature review identifying important elements to adapt the framework, followed by a qualitative case study to characterize how each element, and the dynamics between them, influenced functioning in the UK-PHRST, exploring emerging themes to further refine the framework. Elements of the BMCF that our study reinforced as important included the partnership's mission, partner resources (skills, expertise and networks), leadership, the external environment, management systems and communication. Additional elements identified in the literature and critical to partnership functioning of the UK-PHRST included governance and financial structures adopted, trust and power balance, organizational culture, strategy and evaluation and knowledge management. Because of the way the UK-PHRST was structured, fostering team cohesion was an important indicator of synergy, alongside collaborative advantage. Dividing the funding and governance equally between organizations was considered crucial for maintaining institutional balance; however, diverse organizational cultures, weak communication practices and perceived power imbalances compromised team cohesion. Our analysis allowed us to make recommendations to improve partnership functioning at a critical time in the evolution of the UK-PHRST. The analysis approach and framework presented here can be used to evaluate and strengthen the management of global health partnerships to realize synergy.","Thank you to LSHTM staff and UK-PHRST advisors Karl Blanchet and Prof. Rosanna Peeling, as well as the UK-PHRST Director, Deputy Director (at the time of data collection) and Programme manager, Prof. Dan Bausch, Professor Jimmy Whitworth and Susan Ismaeel, who provided guidance during conceptualization of the study proposal and data collection.","P.R. received no funding for conducting this research or for writing the paper.

To monitor and maintain the ideal growth of children with MSUD, caregivers need to carefully control the consumption of harmful branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs). The dietary limits of amino acids for MSUD patients are recommended and controlled by pediatricians and metabolic dietitians according to age, height, weight, and the prevailing percentage of amino acids in the body. This study introduces an intelligent dietary tool called MSUD Baby Buddy for caregivers of MSUD patients that tracks the amino acids intake out of baby formulas for babies 0-6 months old. This tool aims to provide accurate recommendations of the appropriate daily intake of protein and BCAAs based on the patients' data, plasma BCAAs, and formula preferences. We use a knowledge-based system, including knowledge acquisition and verification, as well as knowledge management tool validation, and the ripple-down rules are employed for building the system. MSUD Baby Buddy can support the maintenance of adequate amino acid levels and increase awareness about the control of BCAAs. The average usability of MSUD Baby Buddy is 84.25, indicating that the tool is intuitive and may help caregivers to easily determine the recommended doses of formula based on patients' biometric data and preferred formula. On the other hand, interviews with metabolic dietitians revealed some drawbacks, which were addressed to further improve the tool. MSUD Baby Buddy is expected to help caregivers of MSUD patients to independently track nutrient intake and reduce the number of visits to the pediatrician and metabolic dietitian.","We thank all the registered dietitians who assisted us throughout the building of the knowledge base, especially Wafa Alabyad for her continued support.","This research was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR) at King Abdelaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, under grant no.

At the same time, the overall output volume of journals and citation metrics have become important parameters in assessing and ranking researchersâ performance. Even though the scholarly interest in cultural heritage has recently increased world-wide, a comprehensive analysis of the publication output volume and its correlation to the shift in the cultural heritage regime starting in 2003 is still lacking. The article aims to understand the role of Web of Science (WOS) as a tool of knowledge management in academia by drawing on the scholarly output volume, the patterns displayed by this volume, and the intellectual structure of cultural heritage research based on WOS-indexed journal articles. The data include 1843 journal articles published between 2003 and 2022 and indexed in the WOS Core Collection. The article draws on a bibliometric analysis by using WOS tools and employing VOSviewer software to map and visualize hidden patterns of research collaboration and avenues of knowledge progress. The cultural heritage research indexed in WOS was found to be Eurocentric, corresponding to the increasing funding provided by European national and supranational agencies for research funding. Although the indexed research has grown significantly, the bulk of studies on cultural heritage in WOS is concentrated in a reduced number of European institutions and countries, written by a small number of prolific authors, with relatively poor collaborative ties emerging across time between authors, institutions, and countries. The central themes reflect the development of digital technologies and increased participatory emphasis in cultural heritage care. This article brings new insights into the analysis of the cultural heritage research in correlation with the emergence of international heritage governance with new institutional actors, professional networks, and international agreements, which are all constitutive elements of scientific production. The article seeks to critically assess and discuss the results and the role of WOS as a tool of knowledge management in academia.","This work was supported by the European Unionâs Horizon Europe research and innovation program under Grant 101079282 (ELABCHROM), by the Academy of Finland under Grant 330602 (HERIDI), and by the Romanian Ministry of Research, Innovation and Digitalization under Grant 28PFE/30.12.2021 (TEHNE).

Nurse managers (NMs) are required to use reports on the KPIs from the District Health Barometer to prepare work plans.
AIM: The aim of the study was to explore the experiences of NMs regarding the use of KPIs in developing work plans.
SETTING: The study was conducted in one of the four local municipalities of iLembe district in KwaZulu-Natal.
METHODS: A qualitative research design was used. Data were collected through semistructured interviews with 20 NMs from seven primary health care clinics between 16 November 2020 and 24 December 2020; data were then thematically analysed.
RESULTS: Nurse managers experienced challenges related to knowledge creation, knowledge sharing and knowledge application regarding the use of KPIs in developing work plans. Possible strategies which, according to NMs, could facilitate the use of KPIs in developing work plans included support in the management role, skills development and orientation, provision of resources and participative management.
CONCLUSION: Relevant knowledge management practices, including knowledge sharing, are essential for knowledge creation so that individuals develop task knowledge to fulfil role expectations. In the case of this study, knowledge creation for NMs could facilitate their appropriate use of KPIs in developing work plans.Contribution: It is recommended that NMs receive ongoing training on, and be actively involved in, data management and that mentoring and support be made available for NMs to facilitate the use of KPIs in developing work plans.","The authors would like to acknowledge Institutional Review Board of Durban University of Technology in KwaZulu-Natal for granting ethical approval to conduct the research project; the iLembe District Department of Health for granting gatekeeper permission for data collection; and the participants of this research, the PHC NMs from the selected local municipality of iLembe district, for sharing their experiences.","This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.",African Journal of Primary Health Care & Family Medicine,,Humans; Nurse Administrators; South Africa; Mentoring; Knowledge; Mentors,2022-11-30,2022,2022-11-30,,14,1,3556,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ngxongo, Thembelihle S.P.; Masondo, Judith N.

Recent advances in the field consider sentiment to be a multi-dimensional quantity that pertains to different interpretations (or aspects), rather than a single one. Based on earlier research, the current work examines the said task in the framework of a larger architecture that crawls documents from various online sources. Subsequently, the collected data are pre-processed, in order to extract useful features that assist the machine learning algorithms in the sentiment analysis task. More specifically, the words that comprise each text are mapped to a neural embedding space and are provided to a hybrid, bi-directional long short-term memory network, coupled with convolutional layers and an attention mechanism that outputs the final textual features. Additionally, a number of document metadata are extracted, including the number of a document's repetitions in the collected corpus (i.e. number of reposts/retweets), the frequency and type of emoji ideograms and the presence of keywords, either extracted automatically or assigned manually, in the form of hashtags. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the semantic annotation of the retrieved keywords, since an ontology-based knowledge management system is queried, with the purpose of retrieving the classes the aforementioned keywords belong to. Finally, all features are provided to a fully connected, multi-layered, feed-forward artificial neural network that performs the analysis task. The overall architecture is compared, on a manually collected corpus of documents, with two other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving optimal results in identifying negative sentiment, which is of particular interest to certain parties (like for example, companies) that are interested in measuring their online reputation.",,,International Journal of Neural Systems,,"Algorithms; Deep Learning; Emotions; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer",2021-08-25,2021,2021-08-25,2021-10,31,10,2150046,Closed,Article,"Alexandridis, Georgios; Aliprantis, John; Michalakis, Konstantinos; Korovesis, Konstantinos; Tsantilas, Panagiotis; Caridakis, George","Alexandridis, Georgios (Cultural Technology Department, University of the Aegean, University Hill, Mytilene 81100, Greece.); Aliprantis, John (Cultural Technology Department, University of the Aegean, University Hill, Mytilene 81100, Greece.); Michalakis, Konstantinos (Cultural Technology Department, University of the Aegean, University Hill, Mytilene 81100, Greece.); Korovesis, Konstantinos (Palo Services, 9, Chavriou Street, Athens 10562, Greece.); Tsantilas, Panagiotis (Palo Services, 9, Chavriou Street, Athens 10562, Greece.); Caridakis, George (Cultural Technology Department, University of the Aegean, University Hill, Mytilene 81100, Greece.)","Alexandridis, Georgios (University of the Aegean)","Alexandridis, Georgios (University of the Aegean); Aliprantis, John (University of the Aegean); Michalakis, Konstantinos (University of the Aegean); Korovesis, Konstantinos (); Tsantilas, Panagiotis (); Caridakis, George (University of the Aegean)",11,10,1.69,7.33,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140665967,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4605 Data Management and Data Science; 4608 Human-Centred Computing; 4611 Machine Learning,

Universities could facilitate students to acquire leadership competencies to move well-conducted research findings into practical use; this could be an essential move to reduce the misuse of investment.
METHODS: A literature review was done based on the Equator Network and Cochrane guidelines, followed by three Delphi rounds to select competencies.
RESULTS: Eleven papers were analysed out of 1121 items and 39/78 identified competencies were prioritized to be presented in the Delphi. Four out of 12 participants accepted to be involved in this project, and 22 competencies reached consensus and stability after three rounds. This framework conceptualizes competencies as the knowledge, skills, attitudes and values. The competencies were framed in four domains: knowledge management, engage diverse others in public health initiatives, training and capacity building/change management and communication.
CONCLUSION: This framework offers guidance to universities when instructing students with leadership competencies for KT. This project emphasizes that effective leadership should include personal conscience and self-determination values.","We gratefully acknowledge Luis Gabriel Cuervo for his willingness and contribution to this project; the acknowledgements also go to the reviewers whose names remain anonymous.

In this study, we reveal how the agile intuition (AI) of top managers with respect to the external environment affects enterprise innovation behavior (IB) based on the cognition-behavior framework. Strategic learning (SL) is considered a moderator, and knowledge sharing (KS) is considered a mediator. The survey sample consists of 305 managers from 47 enterprises in China during the COVID-19 period. The empirical results show that top management agile intuition significantly promotes enterprise IB; knowledge sharing (KS) partially mediates the relationship between top manager AI and enterprise IB; and SL suppresses the promotion effect of top manager AI on enterprise IB to a certain extent, hindering blind innovation. In a surprising result, we find that strategic guidance by an external consultant does not significantly affect the enterprise IB in China.",,"Langang Feng received the project.

This study aims to review interventions used to promote researchersâ and knowledge-producing organizationsâ knowledge and skills in the production and translation of evidence to policy-making and explore the interventions at the individual and institutional level in the Iranian health system to strengthen EIPM.MethodsThe study was conducted in two main phases: a systematic review and a qualitative study. First, to conduct the systematic review, the PubMed and Scopus databases were searched. Quality appraisal was done using the Joanna Briggs Institute checklists. Second, semi-structured interviews and document review were used to collect local data. Purposive sampling was used and continued until data saturation. A qualitative content analysis approach was used for data analysis.ResultsFrom a total of 11,514 retrieved articles, 18 papers were eligible for the analysis. Based on the global evidence, face-to-face training workshops for researchers was the most widely used intervention for strengthening researchersâ capacity regarding EIPM. Target audiences in almost all of the training programmes were researchers. Setting up joint training sessions that helped empower researchers in understanding the needs of health policy-makers had a considerable effect on strengthening EIPM. Based on the local collected evidence, the main interventions for individual and institutional capacity-building were educational and training programmes or courses related to the health system, policy-making and policy analysis, and research cycle management. To implement the individual and institutional interventions, health system planners and authorities and the community were found to have a key role as facilitating factors.ConclusionThe use of evidence-based interventions for strengthening research centres, such as training health researchers on knowledge translation and tackling institutional barriers that can prevent well-trained researchers from translating their knowledge, as well as the use of mechanisms and networks for effective interactions among policy-makers at the macro and meso (organizational) level and the research centre, will be constructive for individual and institutional capacity-building.

Based on the Attributional theory of achievement motivation and emotion, the purpose of this empirical study is to investigate the effects of Emotional Intelligence (EI) on learning outcomes (social, cognitive, self-growth outcomes, and satisfaction with university experience) of academicians in Pakistan's higher education institutions (HEIs). This study also examines the mediating role of teacher competence (personal assessment) and creative performance (Creative self-efficacy and leadership/supervisor support) in a relationship between EI and learning outcomes. Furthermore, this study ascertained the relationship between learning outcomes and organizational performance (OP) of HEIs. This study used a sample frame of 237 academic professionals from Pakistani HEIs, the hypothesized associations were ascertained using the partial least squares structural equation modeling method (PLS-SEM). The findings disclose that EI has a positive and significant influence on learning outcomes. Furthermore, an indirect relation between EI and learning outcomes is established through teacher competence and creative performance while the relationship between learning outcomes and OP is established also. Results of the considered study reinforce the academic understanding of EI and propose how academicians of HEIs can value their competence and creative performance which in turn enhances learning outcomes and OP. There is a lack of studies in HEIs that investigate the relationship between EI, teacher competence, creative performance, learning outcomes, and OP. This is one of the initial researches that not only empirically examine the interface of EI, learning outcomes, and OP of HEIs' academicians but also enlightens comprehensions into the prevailing literature by immediate investigation of the mediating role of teacher competence and creative performance in fundamental association.",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,2022-06-22,2022,2022-06-22,,13,,812447,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cai, Binbin; Shafait, Zahid; Chen, Lifeng","Cai, Binbin (International College, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China); Shafait, Zahid (School of Management, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xiâan, China); Chen, Lifeng (School of Business, Zhejiang University City College, Hangzhou, China; School of Public Affairs, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China)","Shafait, Zahid (Northwestern Polytechnical University); Chen, Lifeng (Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University)","Cai, Binbin (Zhejiang University of Technology); Shafait, Zahid (Northwestern Polytechnical University); Chen, Lifeng (Zhejiang University; Zhejiang University)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.812447/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148860667,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,4 Quality Education

However, in contrast to the quantity of transferred knowledge, the role of knowledge quality has been largely ignored. Drawing on the knowledge-based view (KBV) of the firm, this study explores the influences of structural, relational, and cognitive social capital on product innovation and the mediating role of knowledge quality. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted from firm executives and core members of R&D department and data of 159 Chinese KIFs were obtained. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling was used for hypotheses testing. The results reveal that relational capital and cognitive capital have positive effects on product innovation performance, which are mediated by knowledge quality. However, the effect of structural social capital on knowledge quality is not significant. The results contribute to literature on firm innovation by examining how social capital indirectly affects product innovation performance through the quality of transferred knowledge. Moreover, the conclusions can help top management of KIFs to design more effective informal knowledge management approaches according to differentiated effects of three types of social capital on knowledge quality.",,This article was supported by the National Social Science Fund of China (Project No. 18BJY099).,Frontiers in Psychology,,,2022-10-06,2022,2022-10-06,,13,,946062,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhou, Xia; Min, Min; Zhang, Zhen","Zhou, Xia (School of Business Administration, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China); Min, Min (School of Business Administration, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China); Zhang, Zhen (Business School, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, China)","Min, Min (South China University of Technology)","Zhou, Xia (South China University of Technology); Min, Min (South China University of Technology); Zhang, Zhen (Shandong Normal University)",3,3,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.946062/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151615893,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

However, challenges exist which hinder inter-organisational knowledge transfer, particularly across continents. The ACoRD project aimed to transfer knowledge on digital learning development from UK/EU (provider) to Malaysian (receiver) higher education institutions (HEIs). This study explores the challenges encountered during the knowledge transfer process and lessons learned.
METHODS: This is a qualitative study involving both the knowledge providers and receivers in focus group discussions (n = 25). Four focus group discussions were conducted in the early (n = 2) and mid-phase (n = 2) of the project by trained qualitative researchers using a topic guide designed to explore experiences and activities representing knowledge transfer in multi-institutional and multi-cultural settings. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and checked. The transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Five main themes emerged from this qualitative study: mismatched expectations between providers and receivers; acquiring new knowledge beyond the professional ""comfort zone""; challenges in cascading newly acquired knowledge to colleagues and management; individual and organisational cultural differences; and disruption of knowledge transfer during the COVID-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSION: This study highlights the need to create a conducive platform to facilitate continuous, timely and bi-directional needs assessment and feedback; this should be done in the early phase of the knowledge transfer process.

Anecdotal evidence suggested that CL roles have changed recently.
OBJECTIVES: To examine perceptions of CL tasks and required personal characteristics of CLs, amongst both practising CLs and other LKS staff in England.
METHODS: An online survey was followed by descriptive statistical and content analysis to identify any differences in perceptions between the CL and non-CL staff groups.
RESULTS: Response rate: 10% (123/1181). Both staff groups identified literature searching as the top core task and agreed on the main CL roles. Perceptions on the necessary personal characteristics were also similar. Ranking differed for a few tasks: non-CL staff may ascribe more importance to some tasks (evidence synthesis, critical appraisal training and attending ward rounds/team meetings) than the CL staff state. CLs spent more time on staff management, and less time on study skills training than non-CL staff perceived.
DISCUSSION: Results indicated that CL roles are continuing to develop, but that CLs are more integrated into library administration than some non-CL staff believe.
CONCLUSION: Shared perceptions around CL roles should help workforce development.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Thanks go to the staff of the Library and Knowledge Service at North Bristol NHS for their support with making the research possible.

Digital technology has the potential to transform care through empowering patients, establishing more robust therapeutic relationships as well as supporting stronger teamworking across boundaries and enabling creation of communities and networks to support patients.There is some hesitancy in National Health Service to adopt digital innovation, but the pandemic has transformed use of remote monitoring in a matter of weeks. The pandemic has highlighted how collaboration and digital technology innovation can radically transform health and care services at pace when people are provided with the space and support to be innovative. Nurse and clinical leaders with digital knowledge are key in engaging nurses who need to be at the heart of technological developments and implementation to make sure changes facilitate, enhance patient care and improve clinical practice. This project aimed to create a forum that offered time, space and opportunities to innovate; share learning; and develop cross boundary relationships for project teams implementing technology-enabled remote monitoring or virtual ward solutions.Florence Nightingale Foundation scholar and NHSX Digital Health team ran the forum using community of practice principles. Qualitative data were used to measure any potential value created. Forum members reported increase in their personal knowledge as they managed to learn from others. An online platform created as an extension to the forum enabled members to continue networking and access resources. The forum provided space for relationships to get stronger. This enabled innovation that changed practice and performance around increased uptake of tech-enabled remote monitoring solutions by patients as well as indirect health outcomes. Further work is required to collate quantitative data to confirm these claims from the forum members.","The author would like to acknowledge the Florence Nightingale Foundation and Dr Natasha Phillips, Chief Nursing Information Officer NHS England for the Leadership and Digital scholarship which enabled this project",Florence Nightingale Foundation Leadership scholarship Registered in England and Wales with Charity Reg No. 229229,BMJ Open Quality,,Delivery of Health Care; England; Hospitals; Humans; State Medicine,2022-10-05,2022,2022-10-05,2022-10,11,4,e001952,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kanyimo, Ezra","Kanyimo, Ezra (NHS England, London, UK)","Kanyimo, Ezra (National Health Service England)","Kanyimo, Ezra (National Health Service England)",0,0,,,https://bmjopenquality.bmj.com/content/bmjqir/11/4/e001952.full.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151600162,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4205 Nursing,3 Good Health and Well Being

Both knowledgebase and website were originally developed using a wiki-style approach that relied on manual evidence curation and synthesis of that evidence into cancer-related biomarker, disease, and pathway pages on the website that summarized the literature for a clinical audience. This approach required significant time investment for each page, which limited website scalability as the field advanced. To address this challenge, we designed and used an assertion-based data model that allows the knowledgebase and website to expand with the field of precision oncology.
METHODS: Assertions, or computationally accessible cause and effect statements, are both manually curated from primary sources and imported from external databases and stored in a knowledge management system. To generate pages for the MCG website, reusable templates transform assertions into reconfigurable text and visualizations that form the building blocks for automatically updating disease, biomarker, drug, and clinical trial pages.
RESULTS: Combining text and graph templates with assertions in our knowledgebase allows generation of web pages that automatically update with our knowledgebase. Automated page generation empowers rapid scaling of the website as assertions with new biomarkers and drugs are added to the knowledgebase. This process has generated more than 9,100 clinical trial pages, 18,100 gene and alteration pages, 900 disease pages, and 2,700 drug pages to date.
CONCLUSION: Leveraging both computational and manual curation processes in combination with reusable templates empowers automation and scalability for both the MCG knowledgebase and MCG website.","The authors gratefully acknowledge the subject matter experts, editors, and My Cancer Genome team members, past and present, who have contributed to the My Cancer Genome knowledgebase and website, and Dr William Pao, who was a cofounder of My Cancer Genome.

The method is applied to image classification, and the experimental results show that the method can extract image features more effectively, thus improving the accuracy of feature classification. Since fine-grained actions usually share a very high similarity in phenotypes and motion patterns, with only minor differences in local regions, inspired by the human visual system, this paper proposes integrating visual attention mechanisms into the fine-grained action feature extraction process to extract features for cues. Taking the problem as the guide, we formulate the athlete's tacit knowledge management strategy and select the distinctive freestyle aerial skills national team as the object of empirical analysis, compose a more scientific and organization-specific tacit knowledge management program, exert influence on the members in the implementation, and revise to form a tacit knowledge management implementation program with certain promotion value. Group behavior can be identified by analyzing the behavior of individuals and the interaction information between individuals. Individual interactions in a group can be represented by individual representations, and the relationship between individual behaviors can be analyzed by modeling the relationship between individual representations. The performance improvement of the method on mismatched datasets is comparable between the long-short time network based on temporal information and the language recognition method with high-level semantic embedding vectors, with the two methods improving about 12.6% and 23.0%, respectively, compared with the method using the original model and with the i-vector baseline system based on the support vector machine classification method with radial basis functions, with performance improvements about 10.10% and 10.88%, respectively.",This work was supported by Shanxi University.,,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,"Humans; Mass Gatherings; Neural Networks, Computer; Recognition, Psychology; Semantics; Support Vector Machine",2022-01-12,2022,2022-01-12,2022-01-12,2022,,6761857,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hui, Ruan","Hui, Ruan (Shanxi University, Shanxi, Taiyuan 030006, China, sxu.edu.cn)","Hui, Ruan (Shanxi University)","Hui, Ruan (Shanxi University)",0,0,,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2022/6761857.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144636492,40 Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4602 Artificial Intelligence; 4603 Computer Vision and Multimedia Computation; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

This paper takes the innovation ecosystem as the boundary of the research paradigm. Based on innovation ecosystem theory, knowledge management theory and enterprise innovation theory, this paper constructs a moderated mediation model of the enterprise knowledge search, knowledge integration and breakthrough innovation under the characteristics of innovation ecosystem network. This model is tested on the survey data of 344 technology enterprise and manufacturing industries including R&D departments in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The research results show that: knowledge integration plays part of the intermediary role between knowledge search and enterprise breakthrough innovation; the larger the network scale, the stronger the network connection, the stronger the intermediary role of knowledge integration on the relationship between knowledge search and enterprise breakthrough innovation. The research results reveal the important role of the innovation ecosystem in enterprise breakthrough innovation. At the same time, the research on knowledge search and enterprise breakthrough innovation should consider the network characteristics of innovation ecosystem and the ability of enterprise knowledge integration.",We are grateful to all the participants for their contributions to this study.

1280,pub.1123794733,10.1016/j.amjsurg.2019.12.031,31918844,,Oral examinations in undergraduate medical education â What is the âvalue addedâ to evaluation?,"BACKGROUND: Given the long tradition of oral examinations in surgical training, surgical clerkships continue to use oral examinations to evaluate medical students even though the value of oral examination at the post-graduate level has been questioned. The key issue in the context of undergraduate surgical training then is to understand value of the oral examination in assessment. The goal of this study is to clarify what oral examinations do, or appear to, test and how this complements other methods of assessment.
METHODS: The study is a retrospective, qualitative study of comments provided by examiners on the oral examination score sheets evaluating performance of students completing their core surgery clerkship at an academic medical center. Through immersion in and initial familiarization with the data we develop a scheme of codes for labeling the data for subsequent synthesis. Using these inductive codes, all comments were reviewed and analyzed to determine what qualities examiners detect, or naturally comment on, when administering and scoring the oral examinations.
RESULTS: Thirteen substantive codes (Communication, Critical Thinking, Decisiveness, Demeanor, Differential Diagnosis, Focus, Knowledge, Management, Organization, Pace, Prompting, Thoroughness, and Work Up) and three valence codes (Negative, Neutral, and Positive) were developed and used to code the data. The most universal code was 'Knowledge', used by 43 (100%) of examiners; the most frequently used code was 'Work Up', applied to the comments 437 (21.1%) times. Overall, positive valence was attached to 1146 (55.2%) of codes and negative valence to 879 (42.3%) codes. The most discriminating codes in grading were 'Demeanor', 'Focus', and 'Organization'.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral examinations provide rich opportunity for testing qualities readily tested on other examinations but also many intangible qualities that are otherwise less well or not well tested. As such, the 'value-added' by oral examinations likely justifies their continued use in the evaluation of surgical trainees. The identification of testable qualities should aid in the development of a standardized scoring rubric, the use of which may aid in minimizing subjectivity and bias in what otherwise is a rich assessment tool.","The authors wish to thank Katherine Corso, MS, and Amy Sullivan, PhD for aid in developing coding schemes.",,The American Journal of Surgery,,"Academic Medical Centers; Adult; Clinical Clerkship; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Educational Measurement; Female; General Surgery; Humans; Male; Qualitative Research; Retrospective Studies",2020-01-02,2020,2020-01-02,2020-08,220,2,328-333,Closed,Article,"Pernar, Luise I M; Askari, Reza; Breen, Elizabeth M","Pernar, Luise I M (Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.

To this end, the research draws on the concepts of ""guanxi"" based on the embeddedness theory concept through the lens of employees' happiness. A qualitative case study was conducted within a virtual team (in this case, Taiwanese Farmers' Associations (FAs)), and data were collected from both observations and 36 interviewees. Based on the resulting analysis, the findings show that individuals' knowledge-sharing behavior results from a complex interplay of a sense of well-being, guanxi, and the Chinese culture rooted within such organizations.

This study aims to study how to analyze the knowledge transfer and management of virtual enterprises based on structured cognitive computing. This study explains the basic concepts of structured cognitive computing and virtual enterprises and discusses knowledge transfer. In the experiment of this study, it can be seen from Table 1that in 2015, the growth rate of virtual enterprises reached 13%, the growth rate of virtual enterprises reached 36% in 2019, and it increased by 23% from 2015 to 2019. It can be seen that the development of virtual enterprises is getting faster and faster. From the data in Table 2 in the experiment of this study, we can see that with the increase in virtual enterprises in recent years, it has also brought development to the economy of various regions in China. The average employment rate in each region has increased by 24% at the lowest and reached 30% at the highest. It shows that the virtual enterprise has a great effect on the development of the region. Virtual enterprises can not only promote the growth of regional employment rate but also promote the flow of funds between different regions. Knowledge transfer is an important part of the sustainable development of virtual enterprises. How to carry out effective knowledge transfer and management has become a problem that contemporary virtual enterprises need to think about.

Several factors may contribute to underrepresentation of minorities in clinical trials, including lack of training for researchers and staff on the importance of diversity in clinical trials and effective strategies for recruiting and retaining minority populations.MethodsApplying community engaged research principles, we developed a massive open online course (MOOC) to help research team members develop knowledge and skills to enhance the recruitment of minorities in clinical trials. A transdisciplinary working group, consisting of clinical researchers, community engagement specialists, minority clinical trial recruitment and retention educators and specialists, and knowledge management information scientists, was formed to develop an evidence-based curriculum. Feedback from the Recruitment Innovation Center Community Advisory Board was incorporated to help finalize the curriculum. The course was implemented in Coursera, an online learning platform offering MOOCs. A bootstrap paired sample t-test was used to compare pre- and post-assessments of knowledge, attitudes, and intentions as it relates to minority recruitment.ResultsThe final course, entitled Faster Together, was divided into eight 1-h modules. Each module included video presentations, reading assignments, and quizzes. After 10âmonths, 382 individuals enrolled in the course, 105 participants completed the pre-test, and 14 participants completed the post-test. Participantsâ knowledge scores were higher with an increase in the mean number of correct answers from 15.4 (95% CI:12.1â18.7) on the pre-test to 18.7 (95% CI:17.42â20.2) on the post-test. All post-test respondents (nâ=â14) indicated that the course improved their professional knowledge, and 71.4% of respondents indicated that they were very likely to make changes to their recruitment practices.ConclusionsFaster Together, a massive open online course, is an acceptable, accessible approach to educating research teams on minority recruitment in clinical trials. Preliminary evidence indicates the course increased knowledge on how to recruit minorities into clinical trials and could promote change in their recruitment practices.","We would like to acknowledge Earl B.

Existing bipartite network link prediction is mainly based on the global structure that cannot analyze the role of the local structure in link prediction. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a deep link-prediction (DLP) method by leveraging the local structure of bipartite networks. The method first extracts the local structure between target nodes and observes structural information between nodes from a local perspective. Then, representation learning of the local structure is performed on the basis of the graph neural network to extract latent features between target nodes. Lastly, a deep-link prediction model is trained on the basis of latent features between target nodes to achieve link prediction. Experimental results on five datasets showed that DLP achieved significant improvement over existing state-of-the-art link prediction methods. In addition, this paper analyzes the relationship between local structure and link prediction, confirming the effectiveness of a local structure in link prediction.",,This research was funded by National Key R&D Program of China grant number 2017YFC0907 505.,Entropy,,,2022-04-27,2022,2022-04-27,,24,5,610,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lv, Hehe; Zhang, Bofeng; Hu, Shengxiang; Xu, Zhikang","Lv, Hehe (School of Computer Engineering and Science, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China;, hhlv@shu.edu.cn, (H.L.);, shengxianghu@shu.edu.cn, (S.H.);, xuzhikangnba@shu.edu.cn, (Z.X.)); Zhang, Bofeng (School of Computer and Information Engineering, Shanghai Polytechnic University, Shanghai 201209, China); Hu, Shengxiang (School of Computer Engineering and Science, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China;, hhlv@shu.edu.cn, (H.L.);, shengxianghu@shu.edu.cn, (S.H.);, xuzhikangnba@shu.edu.cn, (Z.X.)); Xu, Zhikang (School of Computer Engineering and Science, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China;, hhlv@shu.edu.cn, (H.L.);, shengxianghu@shu.edu.cn, (S.H.);, xuzhikangnba@shu.edu.cn, (Z.X.))","Zhang, Bofeng (Shanghai Second Polytechnic University)","Lv, Hehe (Shanghai University); Zhang, Bofeng (Shanghai Second Polytechnic University); Hu, Shengxiang (Shanghai University); Xu, Zhikang (Shanghai University)",3,3,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/24/5/610/pdf?version=1651109058,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147464797,51 Physical Sciences,

An extended flipped classroom model with Education 4.0 and organisational learning processes,"This article integrates two visions on the creation of knowledge by students: an academic vision where the person who creates knowledge uses high-level cognitive abilities and, therefore, acquires deeper learning, and an organisational learning vision, where the creation of knowledge adds value to the organisation and the individuals who work in this matter. It starts from a validated flipped classroom model and then adds procedures and cycles of knowledge that make it an active methodology, in such a way that it simultaneously supports organisational learning, using cooperative competencies characteristic of Education 4.0. This proposed hybrid model has been applied online during confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic and, subsequently, in dual mode (students partly in person and the rest online at the same time) and face-to-face mode. The evidence of this research shows that the creation of knowledge by the students, cooperatively and with an organisational learning perspective, has repercussions for improvements in their academic performance by producing deeper learning. In addition, the development of cooperative skills is observed to create and manage a large amount of helpful knowledge for them and other students in their learning process.","This work has been partially funded by the Spanish Government Ministry of Science and Innovation throughout the AVisSA project grant number [PID2020-118345RB-I00] and the IE22.0602 project of the Technical University of Madrid.

As Chinese firms have increasingly engaged in CSR activities, significant attention has been paid to how groups of stakeholders share and exchange knowledge resources strategically to increase their CSR performance. A guanxi network is an important facilitator in the mobilization of knowledge in CSR activities. This study explores how stakeholders strategically leverage their guanxi and structural holes to affect the efficacy of knowledge exchange to increase CSR performance.
Methods: A mixed-methods research approach was employed to gather data from the stakeholders of a Chinese digital firm iStone. Specifically, 325 questionnaires and social network analyses were collected as well as 55 semi-structured interviews were conducted to test the hypotheses.
Results: As a result, structural holes impede knowledge exchange among stakeholders in their guanxi network, but guanxi moderates this impeding effect. In addition, knowledge exchange promotes CSR performance.
Conclusion: By developing a mechanism to reveal how stakeholders' structural hole filling behavior influences their CSR performance, our study places an emphasis on reciprocal resource exchange which generates several implications for CSR performance enhancement. In addition, by demonstrating how structural hole controllers' become 'structural hole fillers' under the moderating influence of guanxi, this study recognizes the cultural contingency that conditions the effect of structural holes on knowledge exchange. This study also suggests stakeholders to cultivate guanxi with their network members who own yet-to-be-filled structural holes to fill their holes and increase firms sustainable performance by giving renqing, returning renqing, earning mianzi and giving mianzi.",We acknowledge the funding support from The Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (Grant No. BK20190550).,,Psychology Research and Behavior Management,,,2022-07,2022,2022-07,,15,,1665-1687,All OA; Gold,Article,"Liu, Jiayuan; Zhu, Yilin; Yan, Jianzhou","Liu, Jiayuan (School of International Pharmaceutical Business, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Peopleâs Republic of China); Zhu, Yilin (Human Resource Department, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Peopleâs Republic of China); Yan, Jianzhou (School of International Pharmaceutical Business, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, Peopleâs Republic of China)","Zhu, Yilin (China Pharmaceutical University)","Liu, Jiayuan (China Pharmaceutical University); Zhu, Yilin (China Pharmaceutical University); Yan, Jianzhou (China Pharmaceutical University)",1,1,,,https://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=81969,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149260783,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health; 52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,

Many companies offer interdisciplinary resources for incumbent learners to break through chronological and geographical constraints. Therefore, it is important to investigate the factors that motivate learners to pay for knowledge-based products. The purpose of this research was to identify the relevant factors that contribute to purchasing intentions and to clarify the reasons why people purchase knowledge-based products. This study involved 406 valid participants over 20 years of age with knowledge purchase experience. The results demonstrated that incumbent learners' need for affiliation has a positive effect on involvement, and that involvement has a significant positive impact on knowledge purchase intentions. The key factor influencing learners to pay for knowledge-based products is their involvement in learning. Information anxiety interferes with the relationship between involvement and knowledge purchase intentions. However, no linear relationship was found between cognitive styles and involvement. Field-dependent learners show greater involvement and also information anxiety than field-independent learners.

Detecting disinformation is challenging due to large volumes of social media content and a rapidly changing environment. This research developed and validated a theory-based, novel deep-learning approach (called TRNN) to disinformation detection. Grounded in social and psychological theories, TRNN uses deep-learning and data-centric augmentation to enhance disinformation detection in financial social media. Temporal and contextual information is encoded as specific knowledge about human-validated disinformation, which was identified from our unique collection of 745,139 financial social media messages about four U.S. high-tech company stocks and their fine-grained trading data. TRNN uses multiple series of long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neurons to learn dynamic and hidden patterns to support disinformation detection. Our experimental findings show that TRNN significantly outperformed widely-used machine learning techniques in terms of precision, recall, F-score and accuracy, achieving consistently better classification performance in disinformation detection. A case study of Apple Inc.âs stock price movement demonstrates the potential usability of TRNN for secure knowledge management.

Previous studies presented the advantages of implementing health and safety management systems (HSMSs) in the construction industry. Few studies have investigated the effectiveness of HSMSs in developing countries. This study adopts a strategic management and multilevel perspective to assess the three main construction HSMS types in South Africa in terms of their adequacy across 14 HSMS dimensions. Methods. A literature review identified 14 health and safety (H&S) management dimensions as building blocks of the strategically developed component of a HSMS. Statistical methods analysed the feedback from a questionnaire survey amongst 59 construction companies on the adequacy of three HSMS types observed in these companies across 14 HSMS dimensions. Results. Differences between the three H&S management types were identified, with inadequacies in three of the 14 H&S management dimensions across all three HSMS types.

Too little is known about personal and perceptual factors for such behavior. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with the use of e-cigarettes among university students in Northern Thailand.
METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 792 university students in Northern Thailand between June and July 2020. An anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was implemented to collect relevant information. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to identify factors associated with the use of e-cigarettes in the last 30 days.
RESULTS: The study revealed that 18.1% of the participants used e-cigarettes in the past 30 days. The personal factors associated with e-cigarette use among Thai university students included: studying in non-health related faculties (AOR=11.21; 95% CI: 4.88-25.71); having a friend using e-cigarettes (AOR=10.48; 95% CI: 5.96-18.41); having a lower GPA than the mean (AOR=1.93; 95% CI: 1.14- 3.28); and having a monthly income higher than the mean (AOR=1.74; 95% CI: 1.09-2.78). Regarding perceptual factors, there was a significant link between e-cigarette use and the perception that these modern cigarettes are less harmful than conventional cigarettes (AOR=2.47; 95% CI: 1.50-4.07), and perception that using e-cigarettes in public is not illegal (AOR=1.93; 95% CI: 1.19-3.15).
CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette use is widespread among Thai university students. Maintaining the enforcement policy on banning the importation of e-cigarettes into the country is thus needed. Also, further communication and public relations on the risks and legal prohibitions of e-cigarette use are needed among university students in the Northern Thailand.","This study was financially supported by the Tobacco Control Research and Knowledge Management Center (TRC) and the Thai Health Promotion Foundation.

Utilizing blockchain technology, bitcoin transactions are recorded in blocks that provide detailed information on all financial transactions. Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant applicability in several industries because of the abundance and processing capacity of large data. One of the main issues is the absence of explanations for AI algorithms in the current decision-making standards. For instance, there is no deep-learning-based reasoning or control for the system's input or output processes. More particularly, the bias for adversarial attacks on the process interface and learning characterizes existing AI systems. This study suggests an AI-based trustworthy architecture that uses decentralized blockchain characteristics such as smart contracts and trust oracles. The decentralized consensuses of AI predictors are also decided by this system using AI, enabling secure cryptocurrency transactions, and utilizing the blockchain technology and transactional network analysis. By utilizing AI for a thorough examination of a network, this system's primary objective is to improve the performance of the bitcoin network in terms of transactions and security.

METHODS: A comprehensive and standardized review of the medical informatics literature was performed to select the most interesting papers of KRM published in 2020, based on PubMed queries. This review was conducted according to the IMIA Yearbook guidelines.
RESULTS: Four best papers were selected among 1,175 publications. In contrast with the papers selected last year, the four best papers of 2020 demonstrated a significant focus on methods and tools for ontology curation and design. The usual KRM application domains (bioinformatics, machine learning, and electronic health records) were also represented.
CONCLUSION: In 2020, ontology curation emerges as a significant topic of research interest. Bioinformatics, machine learning, and electronics health records remain significant research areas in the KRM community with various applications. Knowledge representations are key to advance machine learning by providing context and to develop novel bioinformatics metrics.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: The objective of this Delphi consensus study was to identify strategic recommendations for strengthening the workforce for Health EDRM in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) and high-income countries (HIC).
METHODS: A total of 31 international experts were asked to rate the level of importance (one being strongly unimportant to seven being strongly important) for 46 statements that contain recommendations for strengthening the workforce for Health EDRM. The experts were divided into a LMIC group and an HIC group. There were three rounds of rating, and statements that did not reach consensus (SD â¥ 1.0) proceeded to the next round for further ranking.
RESULTS: In total, 44 statements from the LMIC group and 34 statements from the HIC group attained consensus and achieved high mean scores for importance (higher than five out of seven). The components of the World Health Organization (WHO) Health EDRM Framework with the highest number of recommendations were ""Human Resources"" (n = 15), ""Planning and Coordination"" (n = 7), and ""Community Capacities for Health EDRM"" (n = 6) in the LMIC group. ""Policies, Strategies, and Legislation"" (n = 7) and ""Human Resources"" (n = 7) were the components with the most recommendations for the HIC group.

Two main groups were identified: factors of DT and use in the new digital environment. Using the findings obtained, a comparison was made with the existing literature and the most relevant aspects of DT as a disruptive phenomenon which can generate intra-organizational competitive advantage are exposed.
Objective: To identify the factors of innovation-oriented organizational management, generated by the collaboration of the professional grouping of Kibs companies through the systematization of knowledge, which serve to conceptually delimit the DT phenomenon. Ultimately, it is expected to establish recommendations for this type of companies based on providing services with high knowledge value that strive to digitally transform their businesses.
Originality: the paper contributes to advancing the conceptual understanding of DT through the study of Kibs companies, which remain understudied. Likewise, there is no known study that analyzes the factors that give rise to DT in a professional grouping of small Kibs companies. It is clear that this union of small companies generates a strong internal capacity for knowledge absorption, through daily interactions with clients and public administrations, which favors the process of implementing certain technological and strategic components that are beneficial for the development of professional activity and increases the propensity to innovate.
Methodology: qualitative content was analysed using a grounded theory methodology including interviews with experts and the managers of the Kibs companies in the professional sector to obtain a solid basis that can be used to identify the most relevant factors of DT.
Findings/results: as DT is a multidimensional phenomenon of individual companies, this study presents a conceptual framework for the term with the strategic requirements of the market, organizations, public institutions and technological infrastructures of the professional sector.

It is considered to have great potential to promote health in the forms of art, architecture, landscape, space, and environment. However, there are insufficient design approaches to address the challenges during the HTD process. An increased number of studies have shown that emerging information modeling (IM) such as building information modeling (BIM), landscape information modeling (LIM), and city information modeling (CIM) coupled with blockchain (BC) functionalities have the potential to enhance designers' HTD by considering important design elements, namely design variables, design knowledge, and design decision. It can also address challenges during the design process, such as design changes, conflicts in design requirements, the lack of design evaluation tools and frameworks, and incomplete design information. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a conceptual BC enhanced IM for HTD (BC-HTD) framework that addresses the challenges in the HTD and promotes health and well-being. The structure of BC-HTD framework is twofold: (1) a conceptual high-level framework comprising three levels: user; system; and information, (2) a conceptual low-level framework of detailed content at the system level, which has been constructed using a mixed quantitative and qualitative method of literature analysis, and validated via a pre-interview questionnaire survey and follow-up interviews with industry experts and academics. This paper analyzes the process of BC enhanced HTD and the knowledge management of HTD to aid design decisions in managing design information. This paper is the first attempt to apply the advantages of BC enabled IM to enhance the HTD process. The results of this study can foster and propel new research pathways and knowledge on the value of design in the form of non-fungible token (NFT) based on the extended advantages of BC in the field of design, which can fully mobilize the healing and therapeutic behaviors of designers and the advantage potential of HTD to promote health, and realize the vision of Health Metaverse in the context of sustainable development.","The authors would like to thank all the people who are involved in this research including anonymous reviewers for their putting forward constructive suggestions to this paper.

By the end of 2017, the system had been deployed in 129 health centres, included the health files of 3 million patients, and managed more than 8 million visits per year. We assessed whether preventive-health-care services had improved following implementation of the system.
METHODS: This observational study used three key performance indicators to assess preventive-health-care services reported in UNRWA's annual reports in 2012-17: the percentage of targeted people aged 40 years and older screened for diabetes; the percentage of pregnant women with a livebirth who attended at least four antenatal visits; and the prevalence of growth problems (underweight, stunting, wasting, and overweight or obesity) in children younger than 5 years. Simple descriptive analysis was conducted with Microsoft Excel 2010. Ethical approval was obtained from the UNRWA Headquarters Department of Health.
FINDINGS: Screening for diabetes significantly increased from 13% in 2012 to 21% in 2017 (p<0Â·0001) since the e-Health system started sending alerts to clerks at health centres. The percentage of pregnant women with a livebirth who attended at least four antenatal visits, increased from 87% in 2012 to 92% in 2017, when the e-Health System allowed health-care providers to log all pregnant women who missed their appointments to enable follow-up. Additionally, an electronic maternal and child health mobile application, sends regular reminders to mothers about appointments for themselves and their children. The percentages of underweight, stunting, wasting, and overweight or obesity among children younger than 5 years increased respectively from 3%, 4%, 2%, and 2% in 2014 to 5%, 7%, 4%, and 5% in 2017, but this was due to the increased detection of growth problems through the e-Health system.
INTERPRETATION: The e-Health system improved detection and monitoring by UNRWA health-care providers and access to health services for Palestinian refugees in all three indicator categories. This study has several limitations. It is an observational study based on assessing health records of children rather than a prospective study over time. The focus of the study was to assess the impact of the eHealth system on health-care delivery and not to assess the changes in health-care delivery itself. The electronic health records that were reviewed are for the Palestine refugees who are registered at UNRWA health clinics and not for other refugees or residents of the five countries. Strengths of the study are that it is based on electronic health records which contain data recorded by the treating staff; the e-health system used by UNRWA clinics staff is centralised and the data are aggregated agency wide; and the growth monitoring indicators used by UNRWA were derived from the WHO Multi-center Growth Reference Study to assess the growth of children from birth up to age 5 years.

        Successful employment of experienced employees becomes more important for both, individuals and organizations. To identify organizational practices that foster the motivation, health, and performance of experienced employees in particular, a holistic assessment of relevant organizational factors is needed. The Later Life Workplace Index (LLWI) provides such a measure for organizational practices for older employees by differentiating nine domains, namely organizational climate, leadership, work design, health management, individual development, knowledge management, transition to retirement, continued employment after retirement, and health and retirement coverage. So far, a German-language and an English-language version of the LLWI have been validated in Germany and the U.S in a multi-study procedure. The psychometric properties and measurement invariance of the English-language version of the LLWI will be presented. Preliminary findings from Japan and Portugal show promising results regarding reliability and validity of the LLWI in the respective country. The findings suggest that the multidimensional measurement model developed in Germany and the U.S. could be applicable to other regulatory and cultural contexts as well. A focus group consisting of the original authors of the LLWI and international scholars, whose research expertise lies in the field of employment and older employees, is currently developing a short version of the LLWI. We aim to provide researchers and practitioners from different countries with a validated measurement to holistically assess organizational practices. Researchers can utilize the LLWI to gain a comprehensive understanding of organizational influences on later life work, while practitioners are able to assess their organizational readiness for an aging workforce.",,,Innovation in Aging,,,2022-12-20,2022,2022-12-20,2022-12-20,6,Suppl 1,676-676,All OA; Green,Article,"Deller, Juergen; Finsel, Julia; WÃ¶hrmann, Anne; Wilckens, Max; Gu, Xiuzhu; Oliveira, Eduardo","Deller, Juergen (Leuphana University of Lueneburg, Lueneburg, Niedersachsen, Germany); Finsel, Julia (Leuphana University Lueneburg, LÃ¼neburg, Niedersachsen, Germany); WÃ¶hrmann, Anne (BAuA, Dortmund, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany); Wilckens, Max (Leuphana University Lueneburg, LÃ¼neburg, Niedersachsen, Germany); Gu, Xiuzhu (Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan); Oliveira, Eduardo (University of Porto, Porto, Porto, Portugal)",,"Deller, Juergen (Leuphana University of LÃ¼neburg); Finsel, Julia (Leuphana University of LÃ¼neburg); WÃ¶hrmann, Anne (Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health); Wilckens, Max (Leuphana University of LÃ¼neburg); Gu, Xiuzhu (Tokyo Institute of Technology); Oliveira, Eduardo (University of Porto)",0,0,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9767044,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153837004,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,

The medical expertise of registered physicians in OHCs plays a crucial role in maintaining the quality of online medical services. However, few studies have examined the effectiveness of OHCs in transferring knowledge between physicians and most do not distinguish between the explicit and tacit knowledge transferred between physicians. This study aims to demonstrate the cross-regional transfer characteristics of medical knowledge, especially tacit and explicit knowledge. Based on data collected from 4716 registered physicians on Lilac Garden (DXY.cn), a leading Chinese OHC, Exponential Random Graph Models are used to (1) examine the overall network and two subnets of tacit and explicit knowledge (i.e., clinical skills and medical information), and (2) identify patterns in the knowledge transferred between physicians, based on regional variations. Analysis of the network shows that physicians located in economically developed regions or regions with sufficient workforces are more likely to transfer medical knowledge to those from poorer regions. Analysis of the subnets demonstrate that only Gross Domestic Product (GDP) flows are supported in the clinical skill network since discussions around tacit knowledge are a direct manifestation of physiciansâ professional abilities. These findings extend current understanding about social value creation in OHCs by examining the medical knowledge flows generated by physicians between regions with different health resources. Moreover, this study demonstrates the cross-regional transfer characteristics of explicit and tacit knowledge to complement the literature on the effectiveness of OHCs to transfer different types of knowledge.",This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO. 71971092 and NO.72271102).,,Information Technology and Management,,,2023-05-19,2023,2023-05-19,2023-05-19,,,1-18,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Deng, Zihao; Deng, Zhaohua; Liu, Shan; Evans, Richard","Deng, Zihao (School of Management, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 430074, Wuhan, China); Deng, Zhaohua (School of Management, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 430074, Wuhan, China); Liu, Shan (School of Management, Xiâan Jiaotong University, 710049, Xiâan, China); Evans, Richard (Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University, B3H 4R2, Halifax, NS, Canada)","Deng, Zhaohua (Huazhong University of Science and Technology)","Deng, Zihao (Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Deng, Zhaohua (Huazhong University of Science and Technology); Liu, Shan (Xi'an Jiaotong University); Evans, Richard (Dalhousie University)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10799-023-00400-3.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158195195,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,

However, when dealing with sparse data, they still fall short of expectations. The recent contrastive learning (CL) has shown potential in mitigating the issue of data sparsity. Many item representations are destined to be poorly learned due to data sparsity. It is better to pay more attention to learn a set of influential latent intents that have greater impacts on the sequence evolution. In this article, we devise a novel multi-intent self-attention module, which modifies the self-attention mechanism to break down the user behavior sequences to multiple latent intents that identify the different tastes and inclinations of users. In addition to the above change in the model architecture, we also extend in dealing with multiple contrastive tasks. Specifically, some data augmentations in CL can be very different. Together they cannot cooperate well, and may stumbling over each other. To solve this problem, we propose a multi-policy relay training strategy, which divides the training into multiple stages based on the number of data augmentations. In each stage we optimize the relay to the best on the basis of the previous stage. This can combine the advantage of different schemes and make the best use of them.

Based on the conservation of resources and psychological ownership theories, using a chain intermediary model, this study investigates the effect of justice sensitivity on knowledge hiding through perceived time pressure and territoriality, and further tests the moderating role of territoriality. For the study, we collected 436 questionnaires from China through the Wenjuanxing Sample Service, of which 391 were valid. We then conducted multiple regression analysis and employed the bootstrap method for our tests. The results show that victim sensitivity has a significant effect on perceived time pressure, territoriality, and knowledge hiding, and that a chain mediating effect of perceived time pressure and territoriality is established between justice sensitivity and knowledge hiding. Further, territoriality has a positive moderating effect on perceived time pressure and knowledge hiding, while the mediating effect of perceived time pressure on justice sensitivity and knowledge hiding is also moderated by territoriality. Further, the study offers important practical implications in that enterprises should not blindly pursue results by making employees work excessively overtime. And there should have rationalized regulations in organization to ensure justice. The management should pay close attention to the psychological problems of victim and perpetrator. Instead, enterprises should have a certain degree of control, offer rationales for overtime work, and give high wages to the employees to compensate for their time, thus making the employees feel the worthiness of their overtime work and reducing the probability of engaging in knowledge hiding behaviors.",,,Frontiers in Psychology,,,2022-02-03,2022,2022-02-03,,12,,802171,All OA; Gold,Article,"Jin-song, Zhang; Hua, Huang; Dan-yang, Ruan; Ya-nan, Jin","Jin-song, Zhang (School of Management, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan, China); Hua, Huang (School of Business Administration, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, Wuhan, China); Dan-yang, Ruan (School of Management, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan, China); Ya-nan, Jin (School of Management, South-Central University for Nationalities, Wuhan, China; Clean Production Research Center in Wuhan Optical Valley and the Soft Science Research Base of Low-Carbon Development and Cleaner Production, Wuhan, China)","Ya-nan, Jin (South Central University for Nationalities; )","Jin-song, Zhang (South Central University for Nationalities); Hua, Huang (Zhongnan University of Economics and Law); Dan-yang, Ruan (South Central University for Nationalities); Ya-nan, Jin (South Central University for Nationalities)",0,0,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.802171/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145256440,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

In this context, effective process control using reliable chemical process analytics secures global competitiveness. The setup of those control strategies often originate in process development but need to be transferable along the whole product life cycle. In this series of two contributions, we want to present a combined view on the future of PAT (process analytical technology), which is projected in smart labs (part 1) and smart sensors (part 2). In laboratories and pilot plants, offline chemical analytical methods are frequently used, where inline methods are also used in production. Here, a transferability from process development to the process in operation would be desirable. This can be obtained by establishing PAT methods for production already during process development or scale-up. However, the current PAT (Bakeev 2005, Org Process Res 19:3â62; Simon et al. 2015, Org Process Res Dev 19:3â62) must become more flexible and smarter. This can be achieved by introducing digitalization-based knowledge management, so that knowledge from product development enables and accelerates the integration of PAT. Conversely, knowledge from the production process will also contribute to product and process development. This contribution describes the future role of the laboratory and develops requirements therefrom. In part 2, we examine the future functionality as well as the ingredients of a smart sensor aiming to eventually fuel full PAT functionalityâalso within process development or scale-up facilities (Eifert et al. 2020, Anal Bioanal Chem).",Open Access funding provided by Projekt DEAL.,,Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry,,,2020-02-15,2020,2020-02-15,2020-04,412,9,2027-2035,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Eisen, Kristina; Eifert, Tobias; Herwig, Christoph; Maiwald, Michael","Eisen, Kristina (Arbeitskreis Prozessanalytik, Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker, 60486, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Daiichi Sankyo Europe GmbH, 81379, Munich, Germany); Eifert, Tobias (Arbeitskreis Prozessanalytik, Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker, 60486, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Covestro Deutschland AG, 47829, Krefeld/Uerdingen, Germany); Herwig, Christoph (Arbeitskreis Prozessanalytik, Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker, 60486, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; ICEBE, Research Area Biochemical Engineering, TU Wien, 1060, Vienna, Austria); Maiwald, Michael (Arbeitskreis Prozessanalytik, Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker, 60486, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; Bundesanstalt fÃ¼r Materialforschung und -prÃ¼fung (BAM), 12489, Berlin, Germany)","Maiwald, Michael (; Federal Institute For Materials Research and Testing)","Eisen, Kristina (Daiichi Sankyo (Germany)); Eifert, Tobias (Covestro (Germany)); Herwig, Christoph (TU Wien); Maiwald, Michael (Federal Institute For Materials Research and Testing)",30,15,1.19,13.57,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00216-020-02420-2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124870204,40 Engineering; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education,

The Taiwanese government has developed an age-friendly verification framework for PHC. The aims of this study were to explore the difficulties faced by PHC staff in the implementation of age-friendly policies and their solution strategies.MethodsThis study adopted a qualitative research method. The first stage involved conducting five focus groups with the responsible staff of PHCs (nâ=â41) that have been certified âage-friendly.â The focus groups covered the effectiveness, difficulties, and resources of PHCs in regards to the introduction of age-friendly policies. In the second stage, in-depth interviews were conducted with executives of PHCs (nâ=â5), both certified and not certified as age-friendly, to further compare the difficulties faced by these two types of PHCs, thereby gaining perspectives for solution strategies. The principles of grounded theory were used for data analysis.ResultsFour major PHC strategies are employed in the promotion of age-friendliness. First, organizational management, through which managers apply management methods and analyze the present PHC-related health concerns; second, resource utilization, which refers to the tallying, linking, and integrating of resources; third, business operation process, in which work efficiency is improved through the combination of business operations and staff training; finally, hardware improvement, which is achieved through comprehensive cataloging of facility environments.ConclusionThe implementation of age-friendliness in PHCs requires the efforts of both the service units and government.

Despite technological support, these pests have caused 20% to 40% production losses, a 50% to 60% deficit in performance, and a cost of between USD 70 million and USD 220 million to the world economies, which forces us to rethink actions centered on people as the key elements to develop appropriate solutions. For this, the present study presents a technological proposal centered on small indigenous coffee producer requirements for introducing Industry 5.0 technologies, considering roadmapping, knowledge management, statistical analysis, and the social, productive, and digital contexts of five localities in Mexico. The results show a correlation between monitoring and control, soil analysis, the creation of organic fertilizers, accompaniment, and coffee experimentation, as the actions to be implemented, proposing the introduction of a mobile application; sensors, virtual platforms, dome-shaped greenhouses, and spectrophotometric technology as relevant technologies centered on indigenous coffee producers' requirements.

However, due to their high-precision machining requirements, and the knowledge-intensive characteristics of miniaturized parts, complex manufacturing process problems often hinder production. To solve these problems, a systematic scheme for structured micromachining process problem solving and an innovation support system is required. This paper presents a knowledge-based holistic framework that enables process planners to achieve micromachining innovation design. By analyzing innovation design procedures and available knowledge sources, an open multi-source Machining Process Innovation Knowledge (MPIK) acquisition paradigm is presented, including knowledge units and a knowledge network. Further, a MPIK network-driven structured process problem-solving and heuristic innovation design method was explored. Subsequently, a knowledge-driven heuristic design system for machining process innovation was integrated in the Computer-Aided Process Innovation (CAPI) platform. Finally, a case study involving specific process problem-solving and innovation scheme design for micro-turbine machining was studied to validate the proposed approach.",The authors would also like to express thanks to the collaborators from the Institute of Intelligent Manufacturing of NWPU for their involvements in the CNC machining experiment.,"This work was supported in part by the Natural Science Basic Research Project of Shaanxi Province, China (Grant No. 2019JM-073) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 51805043).",Micromachines,,,2021-11-03,2021,2021-11-03,,12,11,1357,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhang, Dong; Wang, Gangfeng; Xin, Yupeng; Shi, Xiaolin; Evans, Richard; Guo, Biao; Huang, Pu","Zhang, Dong (Key Laboratory of Road Construction Technology and Equipment of MOE, School of Construction Machinery, Changâan University, Xiâan 710064, China;, 2019125089@chd.edu.cn, (D.Z.);, 2020225023@chd.edu.cn, (P.H.)); Wang, Gangfeng (Key Laboratory of Road Construction Technology and Equipment of MOE, School of Construction Machinery, Changâan University, Xiâan 710064, China;, 2019125089@chd.edu.cn, (D.Z.);, 2020225023@chd.edu.cn, (P.H.)); Xin, Yupeng (College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering, Taiyuan University of Technology, Taiyuan 030024, China;, xinyupeng@tyut.edu.cn); Shi, Xiaolin (School of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xiâan 710072, China;, sxl86@mail.nwpu.edu.cn); Evans, Richard (Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS B3H 4R2, Canada;, R.Evans@dal.ca); Guo, Biao (China Huayin Ordnance Test Center, Huayin 714200, China;, guo_biao1234@126.com); Huang, Pu (Key Laboratory of Road Construction Technology and Equipment of MOE, School of Construction Machinery, Changâan University, Xiâan 710064, China;, 2019125089@chd.edu.cn, (D.Z.);, 2020225023@chd.edu.cn, (P.H.))","Wang, Gangfeng (Chang'an University; )","Zhang, Dong (Chang'an University); Wang, Gangfeng (Chang'an University); Xin, Yupeng (Taiyuan University of Technology); Shi, Xiaolin (Northwestern Polytechnical University); Evans, Richard (Dalhousie University); Guo, Biao (); Huang, Pu (Chang'an University)",1,1,0.65,0.59,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/12/11/1357/pdf?version=1635933449,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143009623,40 Engineering; 4010 Engineering Practice and Education; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Variation in COVID-19 patient outcomes between hospitals was later reported.
PURPOSE: This study aims to determine whether sustainers-hospitals with sustained high performance on Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Total Performance Score (HVBP-TPS)-more effectively responded to the pandemic and therefore had better patient outcomes.
METHODOLOGY: We calculated hospital-specific risk-standardized event rates using deidentified patient-level data from the UnitedHealth Group Clinical Discovery Database. HVBP-TPS from 2016 to 2019 were obtained from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Hospital characteristics were obtained from the American Hospital Association Annual Survey Database (2019), and county-level predictors were obtained from the Area Health Resource File. We use a repeated-measures regression model assuming an AR(1) type correlation structure to test whether sustainers had lower mortality rates than nonsustainers during the first wave (spring 2020) and the second wave (October to December 2020) of the pandemic.
RESULTS: Sustainers did not have significantly lower COVID-19 mortality rates during the first wave of the pandemic, but they had lower COVID-19 mortality rates during the second wave compared to nonsustainers. Larger hospitals, teaching hospitals, and hospitals with higher occupancy rates had higher mortality rates.
CONCLUSION: During the first wave of the pandemic, mortality rates did not differ between sustainers and nonsustainers. However, sustainers had lower mortality rates than nonsustainers in the second wave, most likely because of their knowledge management capabilities and existing structures and resources that enable them to develop new processes and routines to care for patients in times of crisis. Therefore, a consistently high level of performance over the years on HVBP-TPS is associated with high levels of performance on COVID-19 patient outcomes.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Investing in identifying the knowledge, processes, and resources that foster the dynamic capabilities needed to achieve superior performance in HVBP might enable hospitals to utilize these capabilities to adapt more effectively to future changes and uncertainty.",We thank John Buresh from OptumLabs for his contribution in creating the analytical data set from the United Health Group Clinical Discovery Database.,,Health Care Management Review,,Aged; United States; Humans; Pandemics; COVID-19; Medicare; Hospitals; Value-Based Purchasing,2023-01,2023,,2023-01,48,1,70-79,Closed,Article,"Al-Amin, Mona; Li, Kate; Hefner, Jennifer; Islam, Nazmul","Al-Amin, Mona (Mona Al-Amin, PhD, MPH, Associate Professor of Healthcare Administration, Suffolk University, Boston, Massachusetts.

The objective of this study was to assess the role of gender differences in the effect of interpersonal trust on employee innovation and the mediating roles of organizational commitment and knowledge-sharing. This study tested research hypotheses with a multi-group structural equation model, using data collected from 688 participants in Shanghai, China. The results showed that interpersonal trust had significant impacts on affective organizational commitment, knowledge-sharing and innovation behavior. Affective organizational commitment and knowledge-sharing mediated the effect of interpersonal trust on employee innovation. Furthermore, the direct impact of interpersonal trust on innovative behavior was significantly higher for women than for men, whereas males' affective organizational commitment increased their knowledge-sharing behaviors. In addition, there were no significant gender differences in the effect of interpersonal trust on organizational commitment and in the effect of knowledge-sharing on innovative behavior. These results confirmed that interpersonal trust was more important for female knowledge-sharing and innovative behavior, and affective organizational commitment was more important for male knowledge-sharing.",The authors gratefully acknowledge all the respondents who participated in this study and other persons who contributed to this work.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a 10-step Clickbusting process and implemented a program that included a curriculum, CDS alert inventory, oversight process, and gamification. We carried out two 3-month rounds of the Clickbusters program at VUMC. We completed descriptive analyses of the changes made to alerts during the process, and of alert firing rates before and after the program.
RESULTS: Prior to Clickbusters, VUMC had 419 CDS alerts in production, with 488Â 425 firings (42Â 982 interruptive) each week. After 2 rounds, the Clickbusters program resulted in detailed, comprehensive reviews of 84 CDS alerts and reduced the number of weekly alert firings by more than 70Â 000 (15.43%). In addition to the direct improvements in CDS, the initiative also increased user engagement and involvement in CDS.
CONCLUSIONS: At VUMC, the Clickbusters program was successful in optimizing CDS alerts by reducing alert firings and resulting clicks. The program also involved more users in the process of evaluating and improving CDS and helped build a culture of continuous evaluation and improvement of clinical content in the electronic health record.",,,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,,"Decision Support Systems, Clinical;

However, the role of social networks in knowledge sharing of health technology is still largely unknown. To address this issue, the study aims to clarify the influence of clinicians' social networks on knowledge sharing of health technology within the ICS. A questionnaire survey was conducted among the clinicians in the Alliance of Liver Disease Specialists in Fujian Province, China. Social network analysis was conducted using NetDraw and UCINET, and the quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) multiple regression was used to analyze the influencing factors of knowledge sharing of health technology. The results showed that the ICS played an insufficient role in promoting overall knowledge sharing, especially inter-institutional knowledge sharing. Trust, emotional support, material support, and cognitive proximity positively influenced knowledge sharing of health technology, while the frequency of interaction and relationship importance had a negative impact on it. The finding extended the research scope of social network theory to the field of healthcare and will bridge the evidence gap in the influence of the clinicians' social networks on their knowledge sharing within the ICS, providing new ideas to boost knowledge sharing and diffusion of appropriate health technology.","The authors acknowledge the support of each hospital for their involvement in this study during the data collection process, as well as all those who contributed to the field coordination efforts.

This study aimed to investigate the effect of an integrated smoking cessation service model (ISCSM) on enhancing cessation among smokers in a community setting.
METHODS: The participants were 144 smokers allocated into two groups, experimental and control with 72 participants each. The ISCSM comprised two sessions: 1) smoking cessation service design and training smoking cessation capacity for the Community Health Workers (CHWs) by nurses; and 2) integrated smoking cessation service delivery. The CHWs offered brief advice for smoking cessation for smokers through home visits under supervision by nurses, then referred to proactive multisession intensive telephone counselling that was behavioral therapy with follow-up. In contrast, the control group received Thai therapy, which was mouthwash. The 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) was assessed 30 days after the quit date. The probability of quitting between the experimental and control groups was calculated by the risk ratio (RR). Propensity score matching was performed to analyze the treatment effect after balancing the covariate factors.
RESULTS: The probability of quitting smoking successfully among the participants in the experimental group was 7.5 times higher than the control group (Ï2=46.18, RR=7.50, p<0.001). For the treatment effect tested by the PSM, the ISCSM efficiently impacted the 7-day PPA at 30 days among smokers in the experimental group after balancing the covariates (SS=0.281, MS=0.281, df=1, F=13.20, p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study indicate that the ISCSM is an efficient, powerful intervention for enhancing smoking cessation.","The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to the participants in the study, to the Graduate School, Chulalongkorn University, Nakhon Pathom Rajabhat University, and to Tobacco Control Research and Knowledge Management Center for offering a secure foundation, support, and encouragement.",,Tobacco Induced Diseases,,,2022-11-21,2022,2022-11-21,,20,November,1-8,All OA; Gold,Article,"Thanomsat, Kamollabhu; Yunibhand, Jintana; Preechawong, Sunida","Thanomsat, Kamollabhu (Faculty of Nursing, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand); Yunibhand, Jintana (Faculty of Nursing, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand); Preechawong, Sunida (Faculty of Nursing, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand)","Yunibhand, Jintana (Chulalongkorn University)","Thanomsat, Kamollabhu (Chulalongkorn University); Yunibhand, Jintana (Chulalongkorn University); Preechawong, Sunida (Chulalongkorn University)",0,0,,,https://www.tobaccoinduceddiseases.org/pdf-155375-83207?filename=Effectiveness of an.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152928852,42 Health Sciences; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

This approach was applied here to determine the neural representations and underlying dimensions of representation of far more abstract physics concepts related to matter and energy, such as fermion and dark matter, in the brains of 10 Carnegie Mellon physics faculty members who thought about the main properties of each of the concepts. One novel dimension coded the measurability vs. immeasurability of a concept. Another novel dimension of representation evoked particularly by post-classical concepts was associated with four types of cognitive processes, each linked to particular brain regions: (1) Reasoning about intangibles, taking into account their separation from direct experience and observability; (2) Assessing consilience with other, firmer knowledge; (3) Causal reasoning about relations that are not apparent or observable; and (4) Knowledge management of a large knowledge organization consisting of a multi-level structure of other concepts. Two other underlying dimensions, previously found in physics students, periodicity, and mathematical formulation, were also present in this faculty sample. The data were analyzed using factor analysis of stably responding voxels, a Gaussian-naÃ¯ve Bayes machine-learning classification of the activation patterns associated with each concept, and a regression model that predicted activation patterns associated with each concept based on independent ratings of the dimensions of the concepts. The findings indicate that the human brain systematically organizes novel scientific concepts in terms of new dimensions of neural representation.","We thank the Carnegie Mellon Physics Department faculty for their outstanding cooperation.

Information technology is widely used to facilitate the management of this knowledge in healthcare organisations. The purpose of this study is to develop a knowledge management systems success model for healthcare organisations.
METHOD: A model was formulated by extending an existing generic knowledge management systems success model by including organisational and system factors relevant to healthcare. It was tested by using data obtained from 263 doctors working within two district health boards in New Zealand.
RESULTS: Of the system factors, knowledge content quality was found to be particularly important for knowledge management systems success. Of the organisational factors, leadership was the most important, and more important than incentives.
CONCLUSION: Leadership promoted knowledge management systems success primarily by positively affecting knowledge content quality.

Furthermore, this study proposes adaptive leadership as a moderator between learning organizations, change self-efficacy, and organizational innovations. Three hundred seventy-three permanent employees from the pharmaceutical industry voluntarily participated. Data was collected using a simple random sampling technique through the temporal separation method (One-month interval between two temporal separations). SPSS v.25, AMOS v.22, and Smart-PLS were utilized to analyze reliability, validity, descriptive statistics, and correlations, and PROCESS-macro v3.4 was used for direct, indirect (mediation), and interaction (moderation) effects analysis. The study supports the hypothesized link between learning organizations and organizational innovations. In addition, change self-efficacy partially mediates the learning organizationsâââorganizational innovations relationship. Moreover, adaptive leadership moderates the association between learning organization and organizational innovation, learning organizations and change self-efficacy, and change self-efficacy and organizational innovations relationship. The study's findings suggest that adaptive leadership is imperative not only for higher change self-efficacy of the individuals but also helps the organizations for organizational innovations with the utilization of learning organizations phenomenon.

In this paper, we briefly outline the evolution of knowledge management and then propose a conceptualization of knowledge management that incorporates human and social factors for use within a global health context. Our conceptualization of social knowledge management recognizes the importance of social capital, social learning, social software and platforms, and social networks, all within the context of a larger social system and driven by social benefit.

The consequences of leader-signaled knowledge hiding are more destructive to the workplace than the consequences of employees' knowledge hiding. It is particularly necessary to explore the influence mechanism of leader-signaled knowledge hiding on employees' work behavior. Drawing on Conservation of Resources theory, this study establishes a moderated mediation model with emotional exhaustion as a mediating variable and supervisor-subordinate guanxi as a moderating variable. This study focuses on the consequences of leader-signaled knowledge hiding and divides leader-signaled knowledge hiding into self-practiced knowledge hiding and explicit knowledge hiding. Based on the results of 440 questionnaires from tourism employees, it is shown that leader-signaled knowledge hiding has a positive impact on employees' work withdrawal behavior. Specifically, leader's self-practiced knowledge hiding has a greater direct impact on employees' work withdrawal behavior, while leader's explicit knowledge hiding has a greater direct impact on employees' emotional exhaustion. Emotional exhaustion plays a key mediating role in the relationship between leader-signaled knowledge hiding (i.e., self-practiced knowledge hiding and explicit knowledge hiding) and employees' work withdrawal behavior. Supervisor-subordinate guanxi significantly moderates the positive relationship between leader-signaled knowledge hiding (i.e., self-practiced hiding and explicit knowledge hiding) and employees' emotional exhaustion. This study is an extension of previous research on knowledge hiding.

This study puts employees' knowledge hiding behavior in the organizational relationship network situation and discusses the influence of network location on knowledge hiding, exploring the moderating role of knowledge acquisition in the relationship between network location and knowledge hiding. From the perspective of social network, 232 knowledge-based employees were used to obtain the data, and we used literature analysis, social network analysis, multiple regression analysis, UCINET, SPSS, and other software packages. Research shows that employees in the central network are less willing to do knowledge hiding behavior, and those in the structural hole network tend to do knowledge hiding behavior. Knowledge acquisition as the supply way of knowledge resources plays a positive role on the negative relationship between centrality and knowledge hiding and on the positive relationship between structure hole and knowledge hiding.

Compared with other recommendation paradigms, the information available in SBR is very limited. Therefore, capturing the item relations across sessions is crucial for SBR. Recently, many methods have been proposed to learn article transformation relationships over all sessions. Despite their success, these methods may enlarge the impact of noisy interactions and ignore the complex high-order relationship between non-adjacent items. In this study, we propose a self-supervised global context graph neural network (SGC-GNN) to model high-order transition relations between items over all sessions by using virtual context vectors, each of which connects to all items in a given session and enables to collect and propagation information beyond adjacent items. Moreover, to improve the robustness of the proposed model, we devise a contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) module as an auxiliary task to jointly learn more robust representations of the items in sessions and train the model to fulfill the SBR task.

Based on the analysis of 357 sample data, the results show that psychological ownership of personal knowledge significantly negatively impacts employee knowledge sharing, and social alienation is mediating between them. Organizational flexibility significantly reduces the positive impact of psychological ownership of personal knowledge on social alienation, and also plays a regulatory role in the relationship between psychological ownership of personal knowledge and employee knowledge sharing. With the improvement of resource flexibility and cultural flexibility, the intermediary role of social alienation between psychological ownership of personal knowledge and cultural and creative knowledge sharing is becoming smaller and smaller.",,This work was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation Youth Project (No. 72004175) and Social science fund project in Shaanxi Province (2020R014).,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,,,2023-03-23,2023,2023-03-23,,,,1-27,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Yuan, Dan; Song, Zhe; Du, Jiejie; Li, Jing","Yuan, Dan (School of Public Administration and Policy, Xiâan University of Architecture & Technology, Xiâan, China); Song, Zhe (School of Public Administration and Policy, Xiâan University of Architecture & Technology, Xiâan, China); Du, Jiejie (School of Public Administration and Policy, Xiâan University of Architecture & Technology, Xiâan, China); Li, Jing (School of Public Administration and Policy, Xiâan University of Architecture & Technology, Xiâan, China)","Yuan, Dan (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology)","Yuan, Dan (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology); Song, Zhe (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology); Du, Jiejie (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology); Li, Jing (Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13132-023-01355-0.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156442078,38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3803 Economic Theory,3 Good Health and Well Being

This study constructs a structural equation model to explore the impact of user knowledge endowment heterogeneity on remix through the mediating effect of their collaborative psychology. In this empirical study, we collected 25,032 pieces of data from Thingiverse (a 3D printing community) users and their published designs. The findings are as follows. Explicit knowledge endowment heterogeneity has a positive impact on the quantity of remix but a negative impact on its quality. Likewise, the implicit knowledge endowment heterogeneity positively affects the quantity of remix but has no significant effect on its quality. Users' conflicting psychology plays a mediating role between knowledge endowment heterogeneity and remix, while their collaborative psychology negatively mediates merely between explicit knowledge endowment heterogeneity and remix quality. By unraveling the relationship between user knowledge endowment heterogeneity, collaborative psychology, and remix, this study is significant in understanding users' remix process in open collaborative communities and illuminating their psychological mechanism in this process.",,"This work was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China Project âThe Influencing Factors and Mechanism of Knowledge Remixing in Network Innovation Communityâ (No. 18CSH019), Project of Beijing Social Science Fund âResearch on Innovation and Development of E-commerce in the Era of Digital Economyâ (No. 201CC096), and Social Science Foundation of Hunan âStudy on the Demand and Effective Supply of Social Old-Age Service from the Perspective of the Combination of Medical and Health Care in Hunan Ruralâ (No. 19YBQ111).",Frontiers in Psychology,,,2022-06-16,2022,2022-06-16,,13,,941448,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tan, Juan; Qi, Congcong; Gao, Xiaohui; Lu, Jianle; Tan, Qiong","Tan, Juan (Business School, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing, China); Qi, Congcong (Business School, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing, China); Gao, Xiaohui (Business School, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing, China); Lu, Jianle (Business School, Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing, China); Tan, Qiong (School of Economics, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, China)","Tan, Juan (Beijing Technology and Business University); Lu, Jianle (Beijing Technology and Business University)","Tan, Juan (Beijing Technology and Business University); Qi, Congcong (Beijing Technology and Business University); Gao, Xiaohui (Beijing Technology and Business University); Lu, Jianle (Beijing Technology and Business University); Tan, Qiong (Central South University of Forestry and Technology)",0,0,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.941448/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148724711,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,

Apart from that, antecedents and consequences of knowledge hiding are being scrutinized at present. There have been many studies on the triggering forces of knowledge hiding; however, the uncivil behaviors at the workplace have led the organizations and employees in trouble due to its possible associating factors, which is well explained by social influence theory. One such factor that this study has identified is knowledge hiding behavior at the workplace. This is a quantitative cross-sectional study based on a survey. The population taken in this study is the middle and low-level managerial staff of the software houses located in China. The respondents were selected based on convenient random sampling, and a sample size of 287 is used in this study. The data collected were employed with the partial least square structural equation modeling using Smart-PLS 3. The findings of this study show that apart from evasive hiding, playing dumb and rationalized hiding plays a significant role in predicting workplace incivility. In addition, psychological contract breach (PCB) has been taken as the mediating variable. The violation of psychological contracts among employees can indulge them in negative feelings that may convert to workplace incivility at any available opportunity of revenge which is well explained by social influence theory. Workplace incivility cannot be completely eradicated from the organizations; however, it can be controlled by making relevant policies. The civility among the employees can be attained by due managerial interventions and training of the employees considering the protection of victims and due punishment to the perpetrator.",,The funding was provided by the National Key Research Program âResearch on Intelligent Disposal Technology of Multisource Complaint Letters and Visitsâ (2018YFC0831800).,Frontiers in Psychology,,,2022-01-25,2022,2022-01-25,,12,,809683,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wen, Junqi; Zheng, Jiafeng; Ma, Ruijun","Wen, Junqi (School of Labor and Human Resources, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China); Zheng, Jiafeng (Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, Columbia University, New York, NY, United States); Ma, Ruijun (School of Labor and Human Resources, Renmin University of China, Beijing, China)","Ma, Ruijun (Renmin University of China)","Wen, Junqi (Renmin University of China); Zheng, Jiafeng (Columbia University); Ma, Ruijun (Renmin University of China)",2,2,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.809683/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144970141,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,

Then, through the process of analysis and reasoning, further decisions are made. In the information age, the application of intelligent management information systems in various fields has promoted the modernization and intelligence of social development. From the perspective of intelligent decision-making, this paper analyzes the requirements of intelligent information systems and designs an intelligent information system based on mobile Internet management optimization, including system management optimization, and proposes an environment-based layer, network transport layer, and the three-tier system architecture of the smart service application layer. Finally, this paper considers the problem of data fusion after system expansion. According to the existing fuzzy fusion algorithm, a weight-based fuzzy fusion algorithm is proposed. The simulation analysis shows that the algorithm can be effectively applied in intelligent information systems.","This work was supported by Qing Lan Project, Changzhou Key Laboratory of Industrial Internet and Data Intelligence (no.

First, the elements of green technology innovation and their relationships are analyzed and explained. Then, the Complex Adaptive System (CAS) theory is introduced. On this basis, a computer model for the driving mechanism system of corporate green technology innovation is constructed on the Recursive Porus Agent Simulation (Repast) platform. Finally, the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) model is optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), constituting the PSO-BPNN algorithm to evaluate corporate performance. The results of network training and simulation demonstrate that compared with traditional BPNN, PSO-BPNN achieve a faster convergence speed and fewer errors. Besides, the actual output value has a tiny difference from the expected value, showing the application potential of this algorithm in corporate performance prediction. Moreover, the driving factors of green technology innovation greatly affect the profitability and performance of enterprises. Given insufficient corporate profit margin, continuous technological innovation activities can ensure the normal operation of enterprises. A smaller corporate tax rate can shorten the time for the system to reach equilibrium. When the corporate tax rate is above 0.2, the system takes longer to reach equilibrium. In addition, the public opinion coefficient directly affects the time needed for the system to attain equilibrium. When the public opinion coefficient is within 50,00 ~ 6,000 interval, the time that the system takes to reach equilibrium changes significantly.

In an online information service context, this research examines how the perception of easy access to information affects strategies to learn two types of information: ""what it is"" and ""how to access it."" This study also examines how the learning process is moderated by individual differences in working memory capacity, which can determine efficient management of attentional resources. The results show that individuals, especially those who rank high in working memory capacity, are less likely to remember the details but are more likely to remember how to access the information (e.g., a keyword for a search engine query). Those with higher working memory capacity are also more likely to ensure easy access to information by subscribing to information sources. The findings suggest that cognitive miserliness is not due to users' lack of cognitive capacity but to the accessibility of online information and efficient execution of attentional resources.

An evaluation model is constructed for open technological innovation in the IoT industry by analyzing the development of IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) management, network strategy, and AI (artificial intelligence) technology under the development of IoT technology. Meanwhile, IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 and IBM SPSS Amos 19.0 are used to analyze the data information of 306 enterprises in the information technology industry. Besides, the proposed hypotheses are verified by factor analysis, multiple regression, and Back Propagation Neural Network. Finally, a new evaluation index system is constructed for open technological innovation in the new ICT industry. The development of IoT technology provides a primary guarantee for the open technological innovation of the new ICT industry, and the network strategy has the greatest influence on the internal knowledge output mode. Besides, the experimental results indicate that the IoT and artificial intelligence have a critical display value for the open technological innovation of the emerging ICT industry, with the highest weight ratio of 48.25%. This result demonstrates that artificial intelligence is positively correlated with the external input information. Intellectual property management is a crucial guarantee of open technology innovation in the ICT industry. The evaluation model of open technological innovation in the ICT industry has good performance through case analysis, with the highest accuracy of 91.25%.

Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and Public Health England (PHE) have engaged in one such IHP as part of Public Health England's International Health Regulations Strengthening project. Presently, there have been limited evaluations of IHPs resulting in limited evidence of their effectiveness in strengthening health systems despite the concept being used across the world.
Study design: Qualitative, using a validated tool.
Methods: The ESTHER EFFECt tool was used to evaluate the IHP between NCDC and PHE. Senior leadership from both organisations participated in a two-day workshop where their perceptions of various elements of the partnership were evaluated. This was done through an initial quantitative survey followed by a facilitated discussion to further explore any arising issues.
Results: This evaluation is the first published evaluation of a bilateral global health partnership undertaken by NCDC and PHE. NCDC scores were consistently higher than PHE scores. Key strengths and weaknesses of the partnership were identified such as having wide ranging institutional engagement, however needing to improve dissemination mechanisms following key learning activity.
Conclusions: There is a dearth of evidence measuring the effectiveness of international health partnerships; of the studies that exist, many are lacking in academic rigour. We used the ESTHER EFFECt tool as it is an established method of evaluating the progress of the partnership, with multiple previous peer-reviewed publications. This will hopefully encourage more organisations to publish evaluations of their international health partnerships and build the evidence base.",We would like to acknowledge the contributions of all of the participants of the workshop and to the external facilitators.,"This work is funded by the UK Government through Official Development Assistance funds granted to Public Health England through the Department of Health and Social Care Global Health Security Programme in the 2015 spending review, for the delivery of the International Health Regulations Strengthening project.",Public Health in Practice,,,2021-02-08,2021,2021-02-08,2021-11,2,,100090,All OA; Gold,Article,"Razavi, Ahmed; Erondu, Ngozi; Haddock, Katie; Johal, Gurnam; Oyebanji, Oyeronke; Ihekweazu, Chikwe; Okereke, Ebere","Razavi, Ahmed (International Health Regulations Strengthening Project, Global Public Health Division, Public Health England, UK); Erondu, Ngozi (International Health Regulations Strengthening Project, Global Public Health Division, Public Health England, UK); Haddock, Katie (International Health Regulations Strengthening Project, Global Public Health Division, Public Health England, UK); Johal, Gurnam (International Health Regulations Strengthening Project, Global Public Health Division, Public Health England, UK); Oyebanji, Oyeronke (Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Abuja, Nigeria); Ihekweazu, Chikwe (Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Abuja, Nigeria); Okereke, Ebere (International Health Regulations Strengthening Project, Global Public Health Division, Public Health England, UK)","Razavi, Ahmed (Public Health England)","Razavi, Ahmed (Public Health England); Erondu, Ngozi (Public Health England); Haddock, Katie (Public Health England); Johal, Gurnam (Public Health England); Oyebanji, Oyeronke (Nigeria Centre for Disease Control); Ihekweazu, Chikwe (Nigeria Centre for Disease Control); Okereke, Ebere (Public Health England)",0,0,,0.0,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhip.2021.100090,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135198697,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

The aim of this review was to identify factors influencing the success of KM process in health care organisations of developed and developing countries.
METHODS: This review was conducted in 2018. The sources used for searching relevant papers were PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Knowledge, EMBASE and Google Scholar, and the time frame was between 1980 and 2017. The search terms were KM, health care services administration, health care organisation, hospital and clinic which were combined by using AND/OR Boolean operators.
RESULTS: In this review, 13 papers were included. The main success factors influencing KM implementation in health care organisations were organisational culture, information technology, organisational structure, and performance evaluation and measurement. In developed countries, organisational culture was the most frequent factor, while in developing countries, organisational culture and information technology were the most frequent ones.
CONCLUSION: It seems that in developed and developing countries, organisational factors are the most frequent factors influencing successful KM in health care organisations.",Acknowledgement This work was supported by Iran University of Medical Sciences (IUMSâSHMIS_1392/21970).

Psychological preparedness, the primed cognitive awareness and anticipation of dealing with emotional responses in an adverse situation, has assumed a compelling relevance during a health disaster of this magnitude.
METHODS: An anonymized eSurvey was conducted in India to assess psychological preparedness toward the ongoing pandemic with a focus on knowledge, management of own and others' emotional response, and anticipatory coping mechanisms among the survey population. An adapted version of the qualitative Psychological Preparedness for Natural Disaster Scale validated by the World Health Organization was widely circulated over the Internet and various social media platforms for assessment. Results are expressed as median Â± standard deviation. Descriptive statistics were used and figures downloaded from surveymonkey.com.
RESULTS: Of the 1120 respondents (M:F 1.7:1, age 35 years Â±14.1), most expressed a high level of perceived knowledge and confidence of managing COVID-19, such as awareness of the symptoms of the illness (95.1%), actions needed (94.4%), hospital to report to (88.9%), and emergency contact number (89.1%). A majority (95%) monitored regularly the news bulletins and scientific journals regarding COVID-19. However, nearly one-third (29.2%) could not assess their likelihood of developing COVID-19, and 17.5% were unaware of the difference between a mild and severe infection. Twenty-three percent (23.3%) were unfamiliar with the materials needed in an acute illness situation.
CONCLUSION: Psychological disaster preparedness is reasonable, although lacking in specific domains. Timely but focused interventions can be a cost-efficient administrative exercise, which federal agencies may prioritize working on.",,,Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness,,"Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Health Literacy; Humans; India; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",2020-06-25,2020,2020-06-25,2020-06,14,3,387-390,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Agarwal, Vishwesh; Sharma, Supriya; Gupta, Latika; Misra, Durga Prasanna; Davalbhakta, Samira; Agarwal, Vikas; Goel, Ashish; Aggarwal, Shelley","Agarwal, Vishwesh (Mahatma Gandhi Missionâs Medical College, Navi Mumbai, India); Sharma, Supriya (Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India); Gupta, Latika (Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India); Misra, Durga Prasanna (Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India); Davalbhakta, Samira (Byramjee Jeejeebhoy Government Medical College and Sassoon General Hospitals, Pune, India); Agarwal, Vikas (Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India); Goel, Ashish (University College of Medical Sciences, Delhi, India); Aggarwal, Shelley (Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California)","Gupta, Latika (Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences)","Agarwal, Vishwesh (); Sharma, Supriya (Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences); Gupta, Latika (Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences); Misra, Durga Prasanna (Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences); Davalbhakta, Samira (B.

Methods: The data of CHD patients treated in our hospital from January 2019 to January 2021 were analyzed in this retrospective study. One hundred and twenty patients were selected as the research subjects according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria and equally split into the observation group and reference group according to the order of admission. Both groups received routine nursing care, while the observation group was additionally given integrated nursing care based on the medical alliance model to compare the self-efficacy scores, scores of self-management abilities, and incidence of postoperative complications between the two groups before and after nursing. Both groups were nursed for 6 months.
Results: Compared with the reference group, the observation group after nursing achieved a notably higher GSES score (26.10âÂ±â1.30 vs 22.18âÂ±â1.30, tâ=â16.516, P < 0.001), higher scores of self-management ability (P < 0.001) , and a lower incidence of postoperative complications (P < 0.05).

Only recently has knowledge management been receiving attention by the health care sector, in part due to the ever growing amount of information that health care practitioners must handle. It has become essential to develop a way to manage the information coming in to and going out of a health care organization. The purpose of this paper was to summarize previous studies from the business literature that explored specific knowledge management tools, with the aim of extracting lessons that could be applied in the health domain.MethodsWe searched seven databases using keywords such as ""knowledge management"", ""organizational knowledge"", and ""business performance"". We included articles published between 2000-2009; we excluded non-English articles.Results83 articles were reviewed and data were extracted to: (1) uncover reasons for initiating knowledge management strategies, (2) identify potential knowledge management strategies/solutions, and (3) describe facilitators and barriers to knowledge management.ConclusionsKM strategies include such things as training sessions, communication technologies, process mapping and communities of practice. Common facilitators and barriers to implementing these strategies are discussed in the business literature, but rigorous studies about the effectiveness of such initiatives are lacking. The health care sector is at a pinnacle place, with incredible opportunities to design, implement (and evaluate) knowledge management systems. While more research needs to be done on how best to do this in healthcare, the lessons learned from the business sector can provide a foundation on which to build.",A Canadian Institutes for Health Research open grant (MOP 84540) and new investigator award to the first author (MSH 95370) made this research possible.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to discover the association between quality of work life of nurse managers and their participation in implementing knowledge management.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a correlational study. All nurse managers (71 people) from 11 hospitals affiliated with the Social Security Organization in Tehran, Iran, were included. They were asked to rate their participation in knowledge management and their quality of work life. Data was gathered by a researcher-made questionnaire (May-June 2012). The questionnaire was validated by content and construct validity approaches. Cronbach's alpha was used to evaluate reliability. Finally, 50 questionnaires were analyzed. The answers were scored and analyzed using mean of scores, T-test, ANOVA (or nonparametric test, if appropriate), Pearson's correlation coefficient and linear regression.
RESULTS: Nurse managers' performance to implement knowledge management strategies was moderate. A significant correlation was found between quality of work life of nurse managers and their participation in implementing knowledge management strategies (r = 0.82; P < 0.001). The strongest correlations were found between implementation of knowledge management and participation of nurse managers in decision making (r = 0.82; P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Improvement of nurse managers' work life quality, especially in decision-making, may increase their participation in implementing knowledge management.",This research was self-funded.

1231,pub.1141910756,10.1111/jep.13624,34652051,,The Craft of Generalism clinical skills and attitudes for whole person care,"RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Generalists manage a broad range of biomedical and biographical knowledge as part of each clinical encounter, often in multiple encounters over time. The sophistication of this broad integrative work is often misunderstood by those schooled in reductionist or constructivist approaches to evidence. There is a need to describe the practical and philosophically robust ways that understanding about the whole person is formed. In this paper we describe first principles of generalist approaches to knowledge formation in clinical practice. We name the Craft of Generalism.
METHODS: The newly described methodology of Transdisciplinary Generalism is examined by skilled generalist clinicians and translated into skills and attitudes useful for everyday generalist person-centred practice and research.
RESULTS: The Craft of Generalism defines the required scope, process, priorities, and knowledge management skills of all generalists seeking to care for the whole person. These principles are Whole Person Scope, Relational Process, Healing Orientation, and Integrative Wisdom. These skills and attitudes are required for whole person care. If any element of these first principles is left out, the resultant knowledge is incomplete and philosophically incoherent.
CONCLUSIONS: Naming the Craft of Generalism defines the generalist gaze and protects generalism from the colonization of a narrowed medical gaze that excludes all but reductionist evidence or constructivist experience. Defining the Craft of Generalism enables clear teaching of the sophisticated skills and attitudes of the generalist clinician. These philosophically robust principles encourage and defend the use of generalist approaches to knowledge in settings across the community - including health policy, education, and research.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Key elements of this paper were researched as part of a PhD, funded through The University of Queensland and funded by the Australian Government Research Training Program Scholarship and the Advance Queensland Scholar program.

Most research on the effectiveness of KT strategies has focused on individual strategies, i.e., those directly targeting the modification of allied health professionalsâ knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors, for example. In general, these strategies are moderately effective in changing practices (maximum 10% change). Effecting change in organizational contexts (e.g., change readiness, general and specific organizational capacity, organizational routines) is part of a promising new avenue to service quality improvement through the implementation of evidence-based practices. The objective of this study will be to identify why, how, and under what conditions organizational KT strategies have been shown to be effective or ineffective in changing the (a) knowledge, (b) attitudes, and (c) clinical behaviors of allied health professionals in traumatology settings.MethodsThis is a realist review protocol involving four iterative steps: (1) Initial theory formulation, (2) search for Evidence search, (3) knowledge extraction and synthesis, and (4) recommendations. We will search electronic databases such as PubMed, Embase, CINHAL, Cochrane Library, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science. The studies included will be those relating to the use of organizational KT strategiesÂ in trauma settings, regardless ofÂ study designs, published between January 1990 and October 2020, and presenting objective measures that demonstrate change in allied health professionalsâ knowledge, attitudes, and clinical behaviors. Two independent reviewers will select, screen, and extract the data related to all relevant sourcesÂ in order to refine or refute the context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations developed in the initial theory and identify new CMO configurations.DiscussionUsing a systematic and rigorous method, this review will help guide decision-makers and researchers in choosing the best organizational strategies to optimize the implementation of evidence-based practices.Systematic review registrationPROSPERO CRD42020216105",Not applicable,,Systematic Reviews,,"Allied Health Personnel; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Organizations; Review Literature as Topic; Systematic Reviews as Topic; Translational Research, Biomedical; Traumatology",2021-09-23,2021,2021-09-23,2021-12,10,1,255,All OA; Gold,Article,"Latulippe, Karine; LeBlanc, Annie; Gagnon, Marie-Pierre; Boivin, Katia; Lavoie, Pascale; Dufour, JoÃ«lle; Raynard, Emmanuelle Paquette; Richard, Eve; Lamontagne, Marie-Ãve","Latulippe, Karine (Centre de recherche interdisciplinaire en rÃ©adaptation du MontrÃ©al mÃ©tropolitain (CRIR), Pavillon Lindsay de lâIURDPM, 6363, Chemin Hudson, H3S 1M9, MontrÃ©al, QuÃ©bec, Canada); LeBlanc, Annie (DÃ©partement de mÃ©decine familiale et de mÃ©decine dâurgence, FacultÃ© de mÃ©decine, Pavillon Ferdinand-Vandry, UniversitÃ© Laval, 1050 av. de la MÃ©decine, G1V 0A6, QuÃ©bec, QuÃ©bec, Canada); Gagnon, Marie-Pierre (Chaire de recherche du Canada en technologies et pratiques en santÃ©, FacultÃ© des sciences infirmiÃ¨res, Pavillon Ferdinand-Vandry, UniversitÃ© Laval, Canada, 1050 av. de la MÃ©decine, G1V 0A6, QuÃ©bec, QuÃ©bec, Canada); Boivin, Katia (Direction de lâenseignement et des affaires universitaires, CHU de QuÃ©bec-UniversitÃ© Laval, 2705 Boulevard Laurier, G1V 4G2, QuÃ©bec, QuÃ©bec, Canada); Lavoie, Pascale (Direction de lâenseignement et des affaires universitaires, Centre intÃ©grÃ© universitaire de santÃ© et de services sociaux de la Capitale-Nationale, 525, boul.

The Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (PMNCH) has recognized mapping the knowledge management of Maternal Newborn and Child Health (MNCH) as one of the major strategies to be deployed in improving the health of these vulnerable groups. The main aim of this study is to map the knowledge management resources of Maternal, Newborn and Child Health (MNCH) in rural and urban settings of Ilorin West LGA of Kwara state Nigeria.
METHODS: It is a descriptive cross-sectional study with a comparative analysis of findings from urban and rural settings. Epi-mapping was used to carve out the LGA and map responses. The p-value of less than 0.05 was considered significant at 95% confidence level.
RESULTS: The study showed that traditional leader was responsible for more than half of the traditional way of obtaining information by rural (66.7%) and urban (56.2%) respondents while documentation accounts for the main MNCH knowledge preservation for the rural (40.6%) and the urban (50%) dwellers. Traditional leaders (32.2%) and elders (46.7%) were the main people responsible for dissemination of knowledge in rural areas whereas elders (35.9%) and Parents (19.9%) were the main people responsible in urban areas.

BACKGROUND: Nurses' competency directly influences patient safety and the quality and effectiveness of patient care. Challenges of nurse leaders in knowledge management include acquiring, assessing and utilising current knowledge and assessing and enhancing competency.
EVALUATION: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, SCOPUS and ERIC databases in April 2015. The search identified 18 relevant research articles published between 2009 and 2015. The quality of the studies was appraised in accordance with study designs.
KEY ISSUE: Knowledge management is facilitated by an organisation culture that supports learning, sharing of information and learning together. Leader commitment and competency were factors related to leadership facilitating knowledge management.
CONCLUSION: Nurse leaders need evidence-based interventions to support shared learning and to create infrastructures that facilitate competence development. Future research is especially needed to evaluate connections between knowledge management and patient outcomes.

These changes have not been matched by an understanding of what healthcare delivery organizations need to do to adapt and continuously deploy computable knowledge. It is therefore important to begin to conceptualize such changes in order to facilitate routine and systematic application of knowledge that improves the health of individuals and populations.
METHODS: An AHRQ-funded conference convened a group of experts from a range of fields to analyze the current state of knowledge management in healthcare delivery organizations and describe how it needs to evolve to enable computable knowledge management. Presentations and discussions were recorded and analyzed by the author team to identify foundational concepts and new domains of healthcare delivery organization knowledge management capabilities.
RESULTS: Three foundational concepts include 1) the current state of knowledge management in healthcare delivery organizations relies on an outdated biomedical library model, and only a small number of organizations have developed enterprise-scale knowledge management approaches that ""push"" knowledge in computable form to frontline decisions, 2) the concept of Learning Health Systems creates an imperative for scalable computable knowledge management approaches, and 3) the ability to represent data science discoveries in computable form that is FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) is fundamental to spread knowledge at scale. For healthcare delivery organizations to engage with computable knowledge management at scale, they will need new organizational capabilities across three domains: policies and processes, technology, and people. Examples of specific capabilities were developed.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare delivery organizations need to substantially scale up and retool their knowledge management approaches in order to benefit from computable biomedical knowledge.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The conference on which this paper is based was funded by the Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ), grant number AHRQ R13 HS25316â01.

Public sector KM is a research area of growing importance. Findings show that few authors specialize in the field and there are several obstacles to developing a cohesive body of literature. In order to examine their effect of the knowledge management capability [which consists of knowledge infrastructure capability (KIC) and knowledge process capability (KPC)] and organizational effectiveness (OE), this study conducted structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses with 302 questionnaires of Taipei Water Department staffs in Taiwan. In exploring the model developed in this study, the findings show that there exists a significant relationship between KPC and OE, while KIC and OE are insignificant. These results are different from earlier findings in the literature. Furthermore, this research proposed organizational commitment (OC) as the mediator role. The findings suggest that only OC has significant mediating effects between KPC and OE, whereas this is not the case for KIC and OE. It is noteworthy that the above findings inspired managers, in addition to construct the knowledge infrastructure more than focus on social media tools on the Internet, which engage knowledge workers in âpeer-to-peerâ knowledge sharing across organizational and company boundaries. The results are likely to help organizations (particularly public utilities) sharpen their knowledge management strategies.

With bogus resumes filled with published journal articles, universities and other allied institutions are keen to recruit or sustain the appointment of such academics. This often places undue pressure on aspiring academics and on those already recruited to engage in research misconduct which often leads to research integrity. This structured review focuses on the ethics and integrity of management research through an analysis of retracted articles published from 2005 to 2016. The study employs a structured literature review methodology whereby retracted articles published between 2005 and 2016 in the field of management science were found using Crossref and Google Scholar. The searched articles were then streamlined by selecting articles based on their relevance and content in accordance with the inclusion criteria. Based on the analysed retracted articles, the study shows evidence of ethical misconduct among researchers of management science. Such misconduct includes data falsification, the duplication of submitted articles, plagiarism, data irregularity and incomplete citation practices. Interestingly, the analysed results indicate that the field of knowledge management includes the highest number of retracted articles, with plagiarism constituting the most significant ethical issue. Furthermore, the findings of this study show that ethical misconduct is not restricted to a particular geographic location; it occurs in numerous countries.

Knowledge Management (KM) through its tools/techniques provides a pertinent framework for decision-making in healthcare systems. The objective of this study was to identify and prioritize the KM tools/techniques that apply to hospital setting.
METHODS: This is a descriptive-survey study. Data were collected using a -researcher-made questionnaire that was developed based on experts' opinions to select the appropriate tools/techniques from 26 tools/techniques of the Asian Productivity Organization (APO) model. Questions were categorized into five steps of KM (identifying, creating, storing, sharing, and applying the knowledge) according to this model. The study population consisted of middle and senior managers of hospitals and managing directors of Vice-Chancellor for Curative Affairs in Kerman University of Medical Sciences in Kerman, Iran. The data were analyzed in SPSS v.19 using one-sample t-test.
RESULTS: Twelve out of 26 tools/techniques of the APO model were identified as the tools applicable in hospitals. ""Knowledge cafÃ©"" and ""APO knowledge management assessment tool"" with respective means of 4.23 and 3.7 were the most and the least applicable tools in the knowledge identification step. ""Mentor-mentee scheme"", as well as ""voice and Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP)"" with respective means of 4.20 and 3.52 were the most and the least applicable tools/techniques in the knowledge creation step. ""Knowledge cafÃ©"" and ""voice and VOIP"" with respective means of 3.85 and 3.42 were the most and the least applicable tools/techniques in the knowledge storage step. ""Peer assist and 'voice and VOIP' with respective means of 4.14 and 3.38 were the most and the least applicable tools/techniques in the knowledge sharing step. Finally, ""knowledge worker competency plan"" and ""knowledge portal"" with respective means of 4.38 and 3.85 were the most and the least applicable tools/techniques in the knowledge application step.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that 12 out of 26 tools in the APO model are appropriate for hospitals of which 11 are significantly applicable, and ""storytelling"" is marginally applicable.

However, some scholars argue that the Nigerian educational sector is yet to fully appreciate the importance of KM as their KM awareness level is still low. Since measurement is the basic foundation to accomplish success, this paper assesses the KM awareness level in tertiary institutions of south-west Nigeria. Methods: The study applied a survey method using a closed ended questionnaire administered to 50 participants from each of the 10 institutions measured by Likert scaling. Employing SPSS for data analysis, frequency count and percentage score were adopted to analyse the demographic data, and the research hypotheses were analysed with chi square test, Pearson chi square and bivariate correlation (Pearson) analysis. Results: A positive relationship between awareness, current status and level of familiarity was noted. KM awareness level in the institutions is high even though there is a significant difference between the public and private universities, as well as between the students and academic staff. Conclusions: Since an increase in the awareness level increases both current status and level of familiarity which often account for KM success, it is recommend that KM awareness level should continuously be improved upon in Nigerian tertiary institutions.","This study was sponsored by the University of South Africa, South Africa The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.

The purpose of this study was to identify organizational and individual factors influencing attitude and intention to use KM systems among Korean nurses. A cross-sectional survey design was used to study a sample of 245 nurses employed at five hospitals in Seoul. A multiple hierarchical regression was used to examine predictors of nurses' attitude and intention to use. From an individual perspective, nurse's informatics competency was identified as a significant factor influencing attitudes toward knowledge management usage within adhocracy and clan cultures. However, from an organizational perspective, level of hospital information system was identified as a significant factor influencing KM system usage within adhocracy cultures.

The Hub provided the forum for sharing quality improvement plans and other tools which were further highlighted during the CoP calls (key to the practice element of CoPs). CoP calls were curated to create a positive context around participantsâ work by recognizing team successes. In addition to improving care at their local facilities, the community created a shared set of tools which built on their collective knowledge and could be shared within and outside the group.ConclusionsThe PREVENT CoP advanced the mission of the learning healthcare system by successfully providing a forum for shared learning. The CoP was grown through seeding structures that included kickoffs, CoP calls, and the Hub.

An accelerated digitalization of meeting modalities takes place. Formal and informal communication largely takes place virtually, especially in service-orientated knowledge work industries. Especially knowledge generation in creative processes is challenging without physical presence. Inventing innovative solutions or product ideas requires trust and physical closeness. Therefore, our research question is to what extent virtual reality environments can offer an improvement in knowledge creation processes compared to online meetings. Hence, we compare Design Thinking workshops in VR with conventional collaboration tools, to identify potential benefits and further application scenarios for knowledge creation in VR. Thereby, the measurement of the quantitative effect of virtuality on factors like team-cohesion, creativity, communication and idea generation is the center of attention.

BACKGROUND: Effective knowledge management is very important to achieve strong organisational performance. The success or failure of knowledge management depends on how effectively an organisation's members share and use their knowledge. Because knowledge management plays a key role in enhancing nursing performance, identifying the core factors and investigating the level of knowledge management in a given hospital are priorities to ensure a high quality of nursing for patients.
DESIGN: The study employed a descriptive research procedure.
PARTICIPANTS: The study sample consisted of 192 nurses registered in three large healthcare organisations in South Korea.
METHOD: The variables demographic characteristics, implementation of core knowledge management factors and outcomes of nursing performance were examined and analysed in this study.
RESULTS: The relationships between the core knowledge management factors and outcomes of nursing performance as well as the factors affecting the performance outcomes were investigated. A knowledge-sharing culture and organisational learning were found to be core factors affecting nursing performance.
CONCLUSION: The study results provide basic data that can be used to formulate effective knowledge management strategies for enhancing nursing performance in hospital nursing organisations. In particular, prioritising the adoption of a knowledge-sharing culture and organisational learning in knowledge management systems might be one method for organisations to more effectively manage their knowledge resources and thus to enhance the outcomes of nursing performance and achieve greater business competitiveness.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The study results can contribute to the development of effective and efficient knowledge management systems and strategies for enhancing knowledge-sharing culture and organisational learning that can improve both the productivity and competitiveness of healthcare organisations.",Acknowledgements The authors thank Mr. Jon Mann for editing the manuscript of this article for submission for publication.,,Journal of Clinical Nursing,,"Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Knowledge Management; Male; Nurse's Role; Nursing, Supervisory; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Republic of Korea",2014-04-03,2014,2014-04-03,2014-12,23,23-24,3513-3524,Closed,Article,"Lee, Eun Ju; Kim, Hong Soon; Kim, Hye Young","Lee, Eun Ju (Research Institute of Nursing Science, Keimyung University, Deagu, Korea); Kim, Hong Soon (Department of Nursing, Andong Science College, Andongâsi, Gyeongbuk, Korea); Kim, Hye Young (College of Nursing, Keimyung University, Daegu, Korea)","Lee, Eun Ju (Keimyung University)","Lee, Eun Ju (Keimyung University); Kim, Hong Soon (Andong Science University); Kim, Hye Young (Keimyung University)",23,8,0.47,7.13,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1011814364,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4205 Nursing,

The mediating role of HAW between these drivers like WorkâLife Balance (WLB) and Recognition from one side and OLC on the other side has also been evaluated. A survey-based research strategy has been adopted. A survey of 207 academic staff employees working in Egyptian private universities was conducted to test the direct effects of the hypothesized relationships. The findings of this study supported the hypotheses that recognition has significant positive total effect on OLC and partially through the mediating effect of HAW among academic staff at Egyptian private universities. In addition, WLB also was found to have a significant positive total effect on OLC and partially through the mediating effect of HAW. Finally, it was concluded that HAW has a significant positive total effect on OLC and partially mediates the Recognition-OLC and WLB-OLC links. Accordingly, this research provides crucial and major implications for both HR professionals and the top management of Egyptian private universities through considering factors like recognition and WBS while designing an effective total reward system that reinforces the overall organizational learning capabilities in the emerging markets context.",The authors pay special thanks to Prof. Dr. Hosny Hamdy for his expertise and assistance throughout all aspects of our study and for his help in writing the manuscript.

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the knowledge management status in an education system by considering the function of faculty members in creation and dissemination of knowledge. This study was conducted to investigate the knowledge management status among faculty members of the Kerman University of Medical Sciences based on the Nonaka and Takeuchi models in 2015.
METHODS: This was a descriptive-analytical and cross-sectional study. It was conducted on 165 faculty members at the Kerman University of Medical Sciences, who were selected from seven faculties as weighted using a random stratified sampling method. The Nonaka and Takeuchi knowledge management questionnaire consists of 26 questions in four dimensions of socialization, externalization, internalization, and combination. Scoring of questions was conducted using the five-point Likert scale. To analyze data, independent t-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation coefficients, and the Kruskal-Wallis test were employed.
RESULTS: The four dimensions in the Nonaka and Takeuchi model are based on optimal indicators (3.5), dimensions of combination, and externalization with an average of 3.3 were found in higher ranks and internalization and socialization had averages of 3.1 and 3. According to the findings of this study, the average knowledge management among faculty members of the Kerman University of Medical Sciences was estimated to be 3.1, with a bit difference compared to the average. According to the results of t-tests, there was no significant relationship between gender and various dimensions of knowledge management (p>0.05). The findings of Kruskal-Wallis showed that there is no significant relationship between variables of age, academic rank, and type of faculty with regard to dimensions of knowledge management (p>0.05). In addition, according to the results of Pearson tests, there is no significant relation between employment history and dimensions of knowledge management (p>0.05).
CONCLUSION: Considering the function and importance of knowledge management in education and research organizations including universities, it is recommended to pay comprehensive attention to establishment of knowledge management and knowledge sharing in universities and provide the required background to from research teams and communication networks inside and outside universities.","The authors of this paper appreciate the cooperation of the research deputy of the Kerman University of Medical Sciences for providing required background for implementing the project and collecting necessary data for this research.

Effective communication and management ability (Cultural Intelligence) of employees in this type of diverse and heterogeneous environment impacts behavior and performance, affecting the sustainable innovation ability of organizations. Researchers have not yet fully assessed the impact of individuals' cross-cultural management ability on sustainable innovation. Using Cultural Intelligence Theory and Trait Activation Theory, this paper discusses the influence of individual cultural intelligence on sustainable innovation behavior. The results showed that employees' cultural intelligence positively affected their sustainable innovation behavior. Employee knowledge sharing plays an mediating role between intelligence and behavior. Differences in organizational culture have a negative moderating effect on the impact of employees' cultural intelligence on knowledge sharing and sustainable innovation behaviors. The research results provide theoretical guidance for managing organizational cultural diversity and advancing cultural intelligence and sustainable innovation behaviors among employees.","This study was supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China to XS (Project No. 15BGL036) and the Innovation Program of Zhongnan University of Economics and Law to LJ (Project No. 201911049).

Results: The PEH groups rapidly and successfully implemented an online approach using social media. The role of the coordinator changed from being a facilitator to an information broker for navigating the large volume of conflicting information and misinformation.
Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of being an agile organisation, with a 'bottom-up' approach to innovation, and the key role of having an information broker in rapidly changing and complex environments. An appreciation of the importance of the socio-technical system for technology implementation in an organisation was also highlighted, with the use of technologies that are familiar to members of the organisation.",The authors would like to thank Fapesp for funding this research.,"Funding The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This research was partially funded by FAPESP â SÃ£o Paulo Research Foundation [Young Investigator Grant number 2018/15642-1] awarded to Dario Cecilio-Fernandes.

Due to the difference in correlation, the matching degrees between the target and historical items vary. The higher the matching degree, the greater probability they co-occur. Recently, the recommendation performance has been greatly improved by leveraging item relations. As an important bond imposed by relations, these connected items should have a strong correlation in the calculation of certain measures. This kind of correlation can be the biased knowledge that benefits parameter training. Specifically, we focus on tuples containing the target item and latest relational items that have relations such as complement or substitute with the target item in user's behavior sequence. Such close relations mean the matching degrees between relational items and historical items should be highly affected by that of the target item and historical items. For example, given a relational item having relation complement with the target item, if the target item has high matching degrees with some items in user's behavior sequence, this complementary item should behave similarly for the co-occurrence of complementary items. Under guidance of the above thought, in this work, we propose a target-relation regulated mechanism which converts the biased knowledge of high correlation of matching degrees into a regulation. It integrates the target item and relational items in history as a whole to characterize the matching score between the target item and historical items. Experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform a set of state-of-the-art models.",,ZW was supported by the âFundamental Research Funds for Central Universitiesâ (2019JBM023).,PLOS ONE,,Probability,2022-06-24,2022,2022-06-24,,17,6,e0269651,All OA; Gold,Article,"Di, Weiqiang; Wu, ZhiHao; Lin, Youfang","Di, Weiqiang (School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China); Wu, ZhiHao (School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China); Lin, Youfang (School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China)","Wu, ZhiHao (Beijing Jiaotong University)","Di, Weiqiang (Beijing Jiaotong University); Wu, ZhiHao (Beijing Jiaotong University); Lin, Youfang (Beijing Jiaotong University)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0269651&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148944297,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

Moreover, there is little empirical evidence indicating how future human resources in the construction industry value the richness of knowledge sharing and the richness of their innovative behavior. The purposes of this study are (1) to determine which facilitators, from the point of view of master's degree students related to engineering and construction management in Spain, most substantially influence knowledge sharing capability; (2) to test whether knowledge sharing capability (KS) positively influences innovative behavior (IB); and (3) demonstrating whether organizational innovation climate (OIC) is a factor that moderates the relationship between KS and IB. In this research, we have proposed a theoretical model and empirically tested the model in a sample of 253 master's degree students in public universities in Spain. The findings support the proposed model, and the structural equation modeling (SEM) evaluation suggests that, among all the facilitators of KS, information and communication technologies (ICT) stand out among the other facilitators and have a more significant influence on KS.

This study sought to investigate the content shared through FOAMed during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.
STUDY DESIGN: Tweets containing the #FOAMed hashtag posted during a 24-hour period in April 2020 were studied. Included tweets were analysed using the Wiig knowledge management cycle framework (building knowledge, holding knowledge, pooling knowledge and using knowledge).
RESULTS: 1379 tweets contained the #FOAMed hashtag, of which 265 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Included tweets were posted from 208 distinct users, originated from each world continent and were in five different languages. Three overarching themes were identified: (1) signposting and appraising evidence and guidelines; (2) sharing specialist and technical advice; and (3) personal and social engagement. Among 12 subthemes within these groupings, 11 aligned to one of the four dimensions of the Wiig knowledge management cycle framework, and the other focused on building and managing social networks. Almost 40% of tweets related directly to COVID-19.
CONCLUSION: #FOAMed tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic included a broad range of resources, advice and support. Despite the geographical, language and disciplinary variation of contributing users and the lack of organisational structure uniting them, this social media medical community has been able to construct, share and use emerging technical knowledge through a time of extraordinary challenge and uncertainty for the global medical community.",,"The authors have not declared a specific grant for this research from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.",Postgraduate Medical Journal,,"COVID-19; Education, Medical; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Social Media",2020-12-14,2020,2020-12-14,2022-03-01,98,1157,199-204,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Rashid, Mohammed Ahmed; Yip, Sharon Wing Lam; Gill, Deborah; Arfeen, Zakia","Rashid, Mohammed Ahmed (UCL Medical School, University College London, London, UK); Yip, Sharon Wing Lam (UCL Medical School, University College London, London, UK); Gill, Deborah (UCL Medical School, University College London, London, UK); Arfeen, Zakia (UCL Medical School, University College London, London, UK)","Rashid, Mohammed Ahmed (University College London)","Rashid, Mohammed Ahmed (University College London); Yip, Sharon Wing Lam (University College London); Gill, Deborah (University College London); Arfeen, Zakia (University College London)",12,6,2.94,,https://academic.oup.com/pmj/article-pdf/98/1157/199/49914978/postgradmedj-98-199.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133496863,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

Knowledge hiding has taken a new turn into the field of knowledge management. Moreover, the major players in knowledge hiding are the personality characteristics of individuals that have now found a way of expression without coming into the spotlight. This study is a necessary one in this time of online working environments where the role of personality traits and psychological ownership has been explored to understand their impact on the knowledge hiding within the organizations of China, and furthermore, to understand what role social status plays in moderating these relationships. The sampling design used is convenient random sampling with a sample size of 298 managers. This study has used the software Smart-PLS 3.3.3 for analyzing the data. The data relied on and was validated using preliminary tests of reliability and discriminant and convergent validities using the measurement model algorithm. Further, the partial least square technique was used to find the equation modeling for the variables, with the help of a structural model algorithm using 500 iterations for bootstrapping. The findings of the current study show that the personality traits of the ""BIG FIVE"" model positively predict knowledge hiding, except for openness to experience.

However, fraudsters are also sniffing out the benefits. Detecting fraudsters from the massive volume of call detail records (CDR) in mobile communication networks has become an important yet challenging topic. Fortunately, Graph neural network (GNN) brings new possibilities for telecom fraud detection. However, the presence of the graph imbalance and GNN oversmoothing problems makes fraudster detection unsatisfactory. To address these problems, we propose a new fraud detector. First, we transform the user features with the help of a multilayer perceptron. Then, a reinforcement learning-based neighbor sampling strategy is designed to balance the number of neighbors of different classes of users. Next, we perform user feature aggregation using GNN. Finally, we innovatively treat the above augmented GNN as weak classifier and integrate multiple weak classifiers using the AdaBoost algorithm. A balanced focal loss function is also used to monitor the model training error. Extensive experiments are conducted on two open real-world telecom fraud datasets, and the results show that the proposed method is significantly effective for the graph imbalance problem and the oversmoothing problem in telecom fraud detection.",We would like to thank the editors and the anonymous reviewers for their efforts.,"This work is supported by Henan Province Major Science and Technology Project under Grant 221100210100, Central Plains Talent Foundation of China under Grant 212101510002 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 61803384.",Entropy,,,2023-01-11,2023,2023-01-11,,25,1,150,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hu, Xinxin; Chen, Haotian; Chen, Hongchang; Li, Xing; Zhang, Junjie; Liu, Shuxin","Hu, Xinxin (National Digital Switching System Engineering and Technological Research Center, Zhengzhou 450002, China.); Chen, Haotian (The Edward S.

However, while pilot funding is likely necessary, it is not sufficient for successful collaborations. Interdisciplinary collaborations are enhanced when team members acquire competencies that support team success.
METHODS: We evaluated the impact of a multifaceted team development intervention that included an eight-session workshop spanning two half-days. The workshop employed multiple methods for team development, including lectures on empirically supported best practices, skills-based modules, role plays, hands-on planning sessions, and social interaction within and across teams. We evaluated the impact of the intervention by (1) asking participants to assess each of the workshop sessions and (2) by completing a pre/postquestionnaire that included variables such as readiness to collaborate, goal clarity, process clarity, role ambiguity, and behavioral trust.
RESULTS: The content of the team development intervention was very well received, particularly the workshop session focused on psychological safety. Comparison of survey scores before and after the team development intervention indicated that scores on readiness to collaborate and behavioral trust were significantly higher among participants who attended the workshop. Goal clarity, process clarity, and role ambiguity did not differ among those who attended versus those who did not.
CONCLUSIONS: Multicomponent team development interventions that focus on key competencies required for interdisciplinary teams can support attitudes and cognitions that the literature on the science of team science indicate are predictive of success. We offer recommendations for the design of future interventions.","The authors are grateful to all of the U-LINK awardees who responded to the surveys.

However, if knowledge is managed well with Knowledge Management (KM), then it becomes a source for sustainable competitive advantage for organizations. If KM is implemented in an organization, it would improve the organizational competitiveness, performance, and productivity, and facilitate the efficient use of resources. Due to intense competition in the global market, many organizations are moving towards the adoption of KM. The healthcare sectors of many developed countries have moved towards the implementation of KM because it can improve the procuring of knowledge from ongoing activities by the effective use of data repositories. Developing countries have now realized the potential and benefits of KM adoption. Pakistan is one of the developing countries that have recently shown an inclination towards the adoption of KM in its healthcare sector to improve performance of its healthcare. This study was composed of two main research phases. Firstly, the enablers of KM were reviewed from earlier studies. Secondly, interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and MICMAC (Cross-Impact Matrix Multiplication Applied to Classification) techniques were used to show the interrelationships between KM enablers and driving and dependence power of each enabler. The application of ISM and MICMAC technique shows that policy incentive, long-term strategic planning, Information Technology (IT), and alignment of KM efforts with business strategy are the main enablers of KM adoption in the healthcare of Pakistan. Focusing on the identified enablers will help in the implementation of KM. Policy incentives can work as a catalyst to promote KM adoption in the healthcare of Pakistan.",The authors are thankful to the experts that contributed with their time and knowledge for the successful completion of study.

These systems have been around for decades, but have significantly changed over time in complexity and features with the evolution of information technology and the Internet. With the development of these new technologies, the concept of knowledge management has thrived and has had significant impact on the way in which knowledge is accumulated, stored and accessed. This article will describe the historical development of knowledge management systems in oral health, illustrate the technology using examples and explore the future use of these systems with emerging technologies such as Google WaveÂ®. One example of how knowledge management systems may affect the quality of dental education is the DentEd project, where a collaborative website was developed to coordinate dental school visitations and collection of reports from working groups, leading to several important publications. MEDLINE is another example of an effective knowledge management system in health care, providing access to health care-related scientific literature, which is highly organized under the auspices of the United States National Library of Medicine. Another and very differently organized example of an effective knowledge management system is Wikipedia, which is a free, web-based, collaborative, multilingual encyclopedia project supported by a nonprofit foundation. The final example of an effective knowledge management system is all of the social media, including Facebook and Twitter. These tools have proven very powerful in organizing and collaborating.

A standardized assessment tool, however, was lacking. Therefore, we aimed to develop a self-management efficacy questionnaire for patients with PSO (SMEQ-PSO) and evaluate its psychometric properties.MethodsA cross-sectional study developing clinical evaluation tool was conducted from October 2021 to August 2022. In the process of developing SMEQ-PSO, three phases were involved: item generation, item evaluation, and psychometric evaluation.ResultsThe SMEQ-PSO with five dimensions and 28 items was developed. The questionnaireâs content validity index was 0.976. Exploratory factor analysis indicated a five-factor structure (self-efficacy of psychosocial adaptation, self-efficacy of daily life management, self-efficacy of skin management, self-efficacy of disease knowledge management and self-efficacy of disease treatment management) that explained 62.039% of the total variance. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated appropriate fit of the five-factor model. The overall CronbachâÎ± coefficient was 0.930, the test-retest reliability wasÂ 0.768 and the split half reliability coefficients was 0.952.ConclusionsThe 28-item SMEQ-PSO is a reliable and valid tool that can be used to assess the self-management efficacy among patients with PSO and provide personalized interventions based on their individual circumstances to improve their health outcomes.","We would like to extend our sincere gratitude to all participants, head nurse of dermatology in the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University and nursing director of the Seventh Peopleâs Hospital of Shenyang for their assistance and cooperation.",This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NO: 72104044).,Health and Quality of Life Outcomes,,Humans; Self Efficacy; Self-Management; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Cross-Sectional Studies; Quality of Life; Psoriasis; Surveys and Questionnaires,2023-06-06,2023,2023-06-06,,21,1,56,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sun, Yuanhui; Zhang, Xiujie; Yang, Zhen; Wang, Aiping","Sun, Yuanhui (Department of Public Service, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China); Zhang, Xiujie (Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China); Yang, Zhen (Department of Public Service, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China); Wang, Aiping (Department of Public Service, The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China; The First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, No.155, Nanjing North Street, Heping District, Shenyang, Liaoning Province, China)","Wang, Aiping (First Hospital of China Medical University; First Hospital of China Medical University)","Sun, Yuanhui (First Hospital of China Medical University); Zhang, Xiujie (First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University); Yang, Zhen (First Hospital of China Medical University); Wang, Aiping (First Hospital of China Medical University; First Hospital of China Medical University)",0,0,,,https://hqlo.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s12955-023-02134-w,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158670502,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

The Doctor of Pharmacy program is one of the programs in which FA is usually implemented. This study aimed to describe the correlation between FA scores and summative assessment (SA) scores and to suggest possible key success factors that affect the effectiveness of FA.MethodsThis study employed a retrospective design using mixed methods for data collection. Data in the semesters 1/2020 and 2/2020 of the Doctor of Pharmacy curriculum in a Thailand pharmacy school were used. Three sets of data were gathered, including the course information (e.g. FA methods, FA scores, and SA scores) from 38 records, self-reports from 326 students and 27 teachers, and 5 focus group discussions. The quantitative data were statistically analyzed using descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation, while the qualitative data were analyzed using a content analysis framework.ResultsThe analysis revealed five main methods that were used for FA, including individual quizzes, individual reports, individual skill assessments, group presentations, and group reports. Of all 38 courses, 29 (76.32%) had significant correlations between FA and SA scores at p-valuesâ<â0.05. The individual FA score was related to the correlation coefficient of the courses (p-valueâ=â0.007), but the group FA score was not related (p-valueâ=â0.081). In addition, only the frequency of individual quiz had a significant effect on the correlation coefficient. Moreover, the key success factors which affected the effectiveness of FA were divided into six themes, including the appropriate method, an effective reflection, frequency of assessment, the appropriate score, the adequate support system, and teacher knowledge management.ConclusionThe subjects that used individual FA methods provided a significant correlation between FA and SA, while those who used group FA methods did not show a significant correlation. Additionally, the key success factors in this study were appropriate assessment methods, frequency of assessment, effective feedback, appropriate scoring, and a proper support system.",We wish to express our heartfelt appreciation to all informants who provided information for deeper understanding of learning and teaching practices in the Doctor of Pharmacy program.,"This study was supported by Walailak University, Thailand (Contract No. WUDPL 64002).

It improves the quality of patient care, reduces the cost of medical procedures, maintaining flawless operations and supports clinical decisions. Despite strong policy interest and vast potential benefits of IoT in the healthcare supply chain, the actual adoption rate is relatively low and it's in the nascent stage in developing countries like India. The objective of this paper is to identify and analyze the potential barriers which would restrain the healthcare industry from adopting IoT. Based on the review of the literature and brainstorming with experts from industry and academia, 14 barriers were identified for IoT adoption. The contextual relationship between the identified barriers was developed using interpretive structural modeling and the obtained results were used as input to fuzzy MICMAC analysis to determine the driving and dependence power of the IoT adoption barriers. From the result, Legal and regulatory standards, Lack of IT Infrastructure are major barriers influencing the adoption of IoT in the healthcare supply chain. The findings will support the decision-makers to understand the contextual relationship between the IoT adoption barriers in the Indian healthcare supply chain.",The authors sincerely thank the editor and anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments in improving the quality of this paper.

HBM can be used to generate conclusive data that may provide an overview of exposure levels in entire or specific population groups. This knowledge can promote the understanding of potential risks of the substances of interest or help monitoring the success of regulatory measures taken on the political level. Study planning and design are key elements of any epidemiologic study to generate reliable data. In the field of HBM, this has been done using differing approaches on various levels of population coverage so far. Comparison and combined usage of the resulting data would contribute to understanding exposure and its factors on a larger scale, however, the differences between studies make this a challenging and somewhat limited endeavour. This article presents templates for documents that are required to set up an HBM study, thus facilitating the generation of harmonised HBM data as a step towards standardisation of HBM in Europe. They are designed to be modular and adaptable to the specific needs of a single study while emphasising minimum requirements to ensure comparability.

Such competition has deviated knowledge from its main objective which is to understand and explain the phenomena. The remedy to this dilemma is to address a new approach, introduced to higher education in the late 1950s as ""interdisciplinarity."" Accordingly, the main purpose of this article is to propose the strategic instances of operationalizing interdisciplinarity as the key requirements to provide a guideline for designing interdisciplinarity activities.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present survey was carried out through the framework synthesis method. To codify the instances of operationalizing interdisciplinarity, the main elements and structures of the model were set as the basis of the query for each element and structure; an independent query was carried out in the literature of the study. The correspondence of the discovered instances was once more compared with the conceptual boxes of the primary theoretical model. Ultimately, the taxonomy was concluded through the operational instances based on the primary framework.
RESULTS: A total of 152 strategies were identified as implications of operationalization of 13 layers and 38 sublayers of the multilayer interdisciplinary model.
CONCLUSION: The development of interdisciplinarity in the national higher education system requires several measures to be taken at different levels of a discipline or scientific field of study. Relying on this, which is the main basis of entering into interdisciplinarity activities, the present study suggests and presents strategic instances of interdisciplinarity operationalization.",This article was part of a PhD dissertation in medical education with the code of ethics (IR.

Most of the current developments of EHR have focused on providing data for research, patient care and prioritization of healthcare provider resources in other areas. More attention should be paid to using information from EHRs to assist local, state, national, and international entities engaged in HIV / AIDS care, research and prevention strategies. Unfortunately the technology and standards for HIV-specific reporting modules are still being developed.
METHODS: A literature search and review supplemented by the author's own experiences with electronic health records and HIV / AIDS prevention strategies will be used. This data was used to identify both opportunities and challenges for improving public health informatics primarily through the use of latest innovations in EHRs. Qualitative analysis and suggestions are offered for how EHRs can support knowledge management and prevention strategies associated with HIV infection.
RESULTS: EHR information, including demographics, medical history, medication and allergies, immunization status, and other vital statistics can help public health practitioners to more quickly identify at-risk populations or environments; allocate scarce resources in the most efficient way; share information about successful, evidenced-based prevention strategies; and increase longevity and quality of life.
CONCLUSION: Local, state, and federal entities need to work more collaboratively with NGOs, community-based organizations, and the private sector to eliminate barriers to implementation including cost, interoperability, accessibility, and information security.",,,Online Journal of Public Health Informatics,,,2012-12-30,2012,2012-12-30,2012,4,3,ojphi.v4i3.4267,All OA; Gold,Article,"Malmberg, Erik D.; Phan, Thao M.; Harmon, Glynn; Nauert, Richard F.","Malmberg, Erik D.

Areas of investigation that are related to Knowledge Management include: HSG(97)47, evidence-based medicine, clinical governance, information and communication technologies, and the changing role of the healthcare librarian. A diagram is included in this paper which illustrates how the healthcare librarian interacts with resources, staff and practices, so contributing to the knowledge base of health care. The paper concludes that Government policy, new technologies and the push towards the practice of information age medicine are forcing changes throughout the NHS. Recognition of Knowledge Management is still in its infancy in the NHS--it calls for major change in organizational thinking and acceptance by the librarian that their service must also be subject to continuous improvement.",,"Management structure and funding The largest single classification of management responsibility for the library was still held by the Clinical Tutor (34%); Chief Executives came in at 12% whilst a range of functions appeared under âotherâ (54%), such as Human Resources Manager and Directors of IT and Finance. This trend towards involvement of senior trust managers may be advantageous to the librarian, in that a number of respondents indicated that the role of Clinical Tutor was more concerned with issues connected with medical education for junior doctors than with library management during their typical time input of two âsessionsâ per week. Thus, it might be fair to assume that a manager ârather than a medicâwould be more in tune with the âbig pictureâ as libraries aimed to fulfil their role as multidisciplinary units, leaving behind their old image as a service dedicated to medical staff only. Furthermore, hospital managers might also have KM on their own agendas and be receptive to the idea of KMâbased projects involving the librarian. A number of comments centred on the premise that where there was an absence of a fully committed managerâwho was part of the hospital management hierarchyâthis reinforced the division between the library and the rest of the hospital community. Funding streams to healthcare libraries remained complicated; only two respondents received funding from one source, whilst the average number was three. Apart from the practical difficulties in managing a number of funding streams, the lack of one central source also created lines of demarcation, for example respondents reported restrictions on transferring money belonging to one staff group to supplement resources for other groups. Complexity or lack of funding was cited as a barrier to involvement in interdepartmental projects, as was the libraryâs lack of status, for example: âI am funded through 7 different sources but have no Trust fundingâ¦. I cannot neglect my medical work for wider Trust work. If I was funded I could coâordinate across the Trust.âAnonymous âThe main barrier is that the library is seen by many to be peripheral to the organization.âNorth Tees General Hospital These reasons alone suggest that many librarians would encounter obstacles in initiating a KM approachâwhich requires collaboration rather than competitionâmoreover it suggests that the healthcare library function might benefit generally if funding and management were standardized.",Health Information & Libraries Journal,,"Humans; Information Management; Knowledge; Librarians; Libraries, Medical; Medical Informatics; Organizational Culture; State Medicine; United Kingdom; Workforce",2000-09,2000,2008-06-28,2000-09,17,3,136-143,Closed,Article,"Keeling, Carole; Lambert, Sian","Keeling, Carole (Project Officer, Graduate School of Science, Engineering & Medicine, University of Manchester,); Lambert, Sian (Course Leader/Senior Lecturer, Department of Information & Communications, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester, UK)","Keeling, Carole ","Keeling, Carole (); Lambert, Sian (Manchester Metropolitan University)",16,0,0.3,5.89,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1048016071,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

It has technological basis very close to the paradigms of Industry 4.0 (Ind-4.0), so that it is also often referred to as Agriculture 4.0. After the proposal of a brief historical examination that provides a conceptual frame to the above terms, the common aspects of SA and Ind-4.0 are analyzed. These are primarily to be found in the cognitive approaches of Knowledge Management 4.0 (KM4.0, the actual theoretical basis of Ind-4.0), which underlines the need to use Integrated Information Systems (IIS) to manage all the activity areas of any production system. Based upon an infological approach, ""raw data"" becomes ""information"" only when useful to (or actually used in) a decision-making process. Thus, an IIS must be always designed according to such a view, and KM4.0 conditions the way of collecting and processing data on farms, together with the ""information precision"" by which the production system is managed. Such precision needs, on their turn, depend on the hierarchical level and the ""Macrodomain of Prevailing Interest"" (MPI) related to each decision, where the latter identifies a predominant viewpoint through which a system can be analyzed according to a prevailing purpose. Four main MPIs are here proposed: (1) physical and chemical, (2) biological and ecological, (3) productive and hierarchical, and (4) economic and social. In each MPI, the quality of the knowledge depends on the cognitive level and the maturity of the methodological approaches there achieved. The reliability of information tends to decrease from the first to the fourth MPI; lower the reliability, larger the tolerance margins that a measurement systems must ensure. Some practical examples are then discussed, taking into account some IIS-monitoring solutions of increasing complexity in relation to information integration needs and related data fusion approaches. The analysis concludes with the proposal of new operational indications for the verification and certification of the reliability of the information on the entire decision-making chain.","We thank Savio Landonio (from ARVAtec srl, Rescaldina-MI, Italy) for assistance with his personal experience on technology transfer in the sector of Precision Framing techniques, highlighting practical problems in âmanaging precisionâ at real farm scale, and Sandro Liberatori, Director of ENAMA (Italian National Agency for Agricultural Mechanization, Rome, Italy), for his continuous attention and efforts on facing problems of technology certification in the agricultural sector.","This research was partially funded by the Autonomous Province of Bozen-Bolzano within the frame of a Capacity Building program (Alpine Technology, TN802A âunibz) aiming at establishing a new Agri-Forestry Innovation Lab at the NOI-Techpark of Bozen-Bolzano with the purpose of performing certification tasks on systems and technologies to be used in the agriculture and forestry sectors.

If successful, knowledge bases will be part of a new knowledge infrastructureâcapable of facilitating ever-more comprehensive, computational models of biological systems. Such an infrastructure would, however, represent a sea-change in the technological management and manipulation of complex data, inducing a generational shift in how questions are asked and answered and results published and circulated. Integrating such knowledge bases into the daily workflow of the lab thus destabilizes a number of well-established habits which biologists rely on to ensure the quality of the knowledge they produce, evaluate, communicate and exploit. As the story we tell here shows, such destabilization introduces a situation of unfamiliarity, one that carries with it epistemic risks. It should elicitâto use Niklas Luhmannâs termsâthe question of trust: a shared recognition that the reliability of research practices is being risked, but that such a risk is worth taking in view of what may be gained. And yet, the problem of trust is being unexpectedly silenced.

Current solutions propose major practice redesign and investment in sophisticated technology. Knowledge management (KM) is a process that increases the capacity of a practice to deliver effective care by finding and sharing information and knowledge among practice members or by developing new knowledge for use by the practice. Our preliminary research in family medicine practices has suggested improved patient outcomes with greater and more effective KM. Research in other organizational settings has suggested that KM can be facilitated by certain organizational characteristics.
PURPOSE: To identify those organizational characteristics within a family medicine practice that management can effect to enhance KM.
METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: We performed a cross-sectional secondary analysis of second-year data from 13 community family medicine practices participating in a practice improvement project. Practice KM, leaderships' promotion of participatory decision making, existence of activities supportive of human resource processes, and effective communication were derived from clinician's, nurses', and staff's responses to a survey eliciting responses on practice organizational characteristics. Hierarchical linear modeling examined relationships between individual practice members' perception of KM and organizational characteristics of the practice, controlling for practice covariates (solo-group, electronic medical record use, and perception of a chaotic practice environment) and staff-level covariates (gender, age, and role).
FINDINGS: Practices with greater participatory decision making and human resources' processes and effective communication significantly (p < .019, p < .0001, and p < .004) increased odds of reporting satisfactory KM (odds ratio = 2.48, 95% confidence interval = 1.32-4.65; odds ratio = 10.84, 95% confidence interval = 4.04-29.12; and odds ratio = 4.95, 95% confidence interval = 2.02-12.16). The sizes of these effects were not substantially changed even when practice members perceived their practice environment as more chaotic.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Steps to facilitate KM should be considered when evaluating more intensive and costly organizational solutions for enhancing family medicine practice performance.",,,Health Care Management Review,,Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family Practice; Female; Humans; Information Dissemination; Knowledge; Male; Middle Aged; Professional Competence; Quality of Health Care,2008-07,2008,,2008-07,33,3,216-224,Closed,Article,"Orzano, A.

A research model was established to verify several hypotheses. The research model based on integrated concepts of knowledge management and technology acceptance modeling. Participants were employees of enterprises in Taiwan, selected by combining snowball and convenience sampling. Data obtained from 779 e-surveys. Multiple-regression analysis was employed for hypothesis verification. The results indicate that perceived ease-of-use of mobile devices was affected by computer self-efficacy and computer playfulness directly; meanwhile, perceived ease-of-use directly affects perceived usefulness. In addition, perceived ease-of-use and perceived usefulness can predict information-sharing behavior in a positive manner, and impact knowledge transfer as well. Based on the research findings, it suggested that enterprises should utilize mobile information devices to create more contact with customers and enrich their service network. In addition, it is recommended that managers use mobile devices to transmit key information to their staff and that they use these devices for problem-solving and decision-making. Further, the staff's skills pertaining to the operation of mobile information devices and to fully implement their features are reinforced in order to inspire the users' knowledge transfer. Enhancing the playfulness of the interface is also important. In general, it is useful to promote knowledge transfer behavior within an organization by motivating members to share information and ideas via mobile information devices. In addition, a well-designed interface can facilitate employees' use of these devices.","This work was supported by Tianjin philosophy and social science planning project (No. TJGL13-028), The Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. ZXH2012N002).

It is a system in which a record of transactions is maintained across several computers that are linked in a peer-to-peer network. Hence, it allows the creation of a decentralized environment, where data are not under the control of any third-party organization. This study presents a Systematic Bibliometric Literature Review (LRSB in further text) of research on blockchain applications in the higher education field. The review integrated 37 articles presenting up-to-date knowledge on current implications pertaining to the use of blockchain technology for improving higher education processes. The LRSB findings indicate that blockchain is being used to build up new interventions to improve the prevailing ways of sharing, delivering and securing knowledge data and personal student records. The application of blockchain technology is carrying on a conceptual progress in the higher education sector where it has added substantial value by ameliorated efficiency, effectiveness, privacy control, technological improvement and security of data management mechanisms. Challenges posed by current literature and further research directions are suggested.","We would like to express our gratitude to the Editor and the Referees.

Environmental health practitioners are responsible for reporting and investigating notifiable diseases.
Aim: The study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practices on notifiable diseases among environmental health practitioners within a metropolitan municipality.
Setting: The study was conducted in the seven regions of the City of Johannesburg in Gauteng province, South Africa.
Methods: A cross-sectional and descriptive study was used. One hundred and thirty-five participants were randomly sampled. The data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire and analysed using version 27 of the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. All ethical considerations such as permissions, ethical clearance and informed consent were observed throughout the study.
Results: The majority of participants (n = 64; 47.4%) were aged between 30 and 39 years and had a BTech/Honours degree (n = 106; 78.5%). A total of 106 (78.5%) participants had received formal training, while 83.7% (n = 113) of the participants understood notifiable diseases. Years of experience had a significant negative correlation with the 'need to report notifiable diseases' (r = -0.193; p = 0.025).
Conclusion: The results could facilitate a knowledge improvement programme that includes a structured training programme and standard operating procedures. The study results cannot be generalised to the whole country; hence, the recommendation of a national survey on similar phenomena should be considered.
Contribution: The study findings could assist in improving the role of environmental health services in reporting and investigating notifiable diseases.",The authors would like to acknowledge the participants who participated in the study.,"This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.",Health SA Gesondheid,,,2022-12-07,2022,2022-12-07,,27,,1980,All OA; Gold,Article,"Thompson, Velisha; Shirinde, Joyce; Mbonane, Thokozani P","Thompson, Velisha (Department of Environmental Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.); Shirinde, Joyce (School of Health Systems and Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Pretoria, Tshwane, South Africa.); Mbonane, Thokozani P (Department of Environmental Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Johannesburg, Johannesburg, South Africa.)","Mbonane, Thokozani P (University of Johannesburg)","Thompson, Velisha (University of Johannesburg); Shirinde, Joyce (University of Pretoria); Mbonane, Thokozani P (University of Johannesburg)",0,0,,,https://hsag.co.za/index.php/hsag/article/download/1980/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153811517,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,3 Good Health and Well Being

From humanities research to government decision-making, from precision medicine to quantitative finance, from customer management to marketing, massive text, as one of the most important information carriers, plays an important role everywhere. The text data generated in these practical problems of humanities research, financial industry, marketing, and other fields often has obvious domain characteristics, often containing the professional vocabulary and unique language patterns in these fields and often accompanied by a variety of ""noise."" Dealing with such texts is a great challenge for the current technical conditions, especially for Chinese texts. A clustering algorithm provides a better solution for text big data information processing. Clustering algorithm is the main body of cluster analysis, K-means algorithm with its implementation principle is simple, low time complexity is widely used in the field of cluster analysis, but its K value needs to be preset, initial clustering center random selection into local optimal solution, other clustering algorithm, such as mean drift clustering, K-means clustering in mining text big data. In view of the problems of the above algorithm, this paper first extracts and analyzes the text big data and then does experiments with the clustering algorithm. Experimental conclusion: by analyzing large-scale text data limited to large-scale and simple data set, the traditional K-means algorithm has low efficiency and reduced accuracy, and the K-means algorithm is susceptible to the influence of initial center and abnormal data. According to the above problems, the K-means cluster analysis algorithm for data sets with large data volumes is analyzed and improved to improve its execution efficiency and accuracy on data sets with large data volume set. Mean shift clustering can be regarded as making many random centers move towards the direction of maximum density gradually, that is, moving their mean centroid continuously according to the probability density of data and finally obtaining multiple maximum density centers. It can also be said that mean shift clustering is a kernel density estimation algorithm.",,,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,"Algorithms; Big Data; Cluster Analysis; Databases, Factual",2022-06-08,2022,2022-06-08,2022-06-08,2022,,7042778,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chen, Zi Li","Chen, Zi Li (Institute of General Aviation Industry, Fujian Chuanzheng Communications College, Fuzhou 350007, China)","Chen, Zi Li ","Chen, Zi Li ()",3,3,,,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2022/7042778.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148560671,37 Earth Sciences; 3704 Geoinformatics; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

Knowledge management (KM) is a concrete application of sustainability in healthcare, as organizations (hospitals) that manage their knowledge assets will gain sustainable competitive advantage. Several organizations in developed countries are moving towards the adoption of knowledge management so that they can manage their knowledge well and improve their performance. Due to the effective implementation of KM in developed countries, developing countries are also considering adopting KM in their healthcare. In this study, an attempt has been made to identify the drivers of KM adoption in public and private hospitals of Pakistan. With the help of an extensive literature review and expert opinion, the drivers were identified and a hierarchical structure was developed. Nineteen drivers were identified and screened out by experts. The experts identified the contextual relationships between the drivers during a brainstorming session. The hierarchical model of the drivers for KM in the healthcare of Pakistan was eventually developed using interpretive structural modeling (ISM). The structure has 10 levels, in which ""developed competitive advantage"" formed the foundation of the structure and ""job creation"" and ""improvement in the reputation of healthcare"" formed the topmost level. The ""Matrices d'Impacts Croises Multiplication AppliquÃ© a un Classement"" (MICMAC) analysis classified the drivers by categorizing them according to their driving and dependence powers. One driver is identified as autonomous, six drivers as dependent, seven drivers as linkage, and five drivers as independent. The analysis of KM drivers will provide a good understanding of the interdependence and interactions between them and support the effect adoption of KM in developing countries especially in Pakistan.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Developing Countries; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Promotion; Hospital Administration; Hospitals; Humans; Knowledge Management; Models, Theoretical; Pakistan; Program Evaluation",2019-02-01,2019,2019-02-12,2019-02-01,16,3,508,All OA; Gold,Article,"Karamat, Jawad; Shurong, Tong; Ahmad, Naveed; Afridi, Sana; Khan, Shahbaz; Mahmood, Kashif","Karamat, Jawad (School of Management, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xiâan 710072, Shannxi, China;, jawad@mail.nwpu.edu.cn, (J.K.);, stong@nwpu.edu.cn, (T.S.)); Shurong, Tong (School of Management, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xiâan 710072, Shannxi, China;, jawad@mail.nwpu.edu.cn, (J.K.);, stong@nwpu.edu.cn, (T.S.)); Ahmad, Naveed (School of Management, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xiâan 710072, Shannxi, China;, jawad@mail.nwpu.edu.cn, (J.K.);, stong@nwpu.edu.cn, (T.S.)); Afridi, Sana (Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medical Science, Xiâan Jiaotong University, Xianning West Road, Xiâan 710049, Shaanxi, China;, sanaafridi@stu.xjtu.edu.cn); Khan, Shahbaz (School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xiâan 710072, Shannxi, China;, shahbaz@mail.nwpu.edu.cn); Mahmood, Kashif (Department of Management Science, Bahria University, Islamabad 44220, Pakistan;, kashifmahmood81@gmail.com)","Ahmad, Naveed (Northwestern Polytechnical University)","Karamat, Jawad (Northwestern Polytechnical University); Shurong, Tong (Northwestern Polytechnical University); Ahmad, Naveed (Northwestern Polytechnical University); Afridi, Sana (Xi'an Jiaotong University); Khan, Shahbaz (Northwestern Polytechnical University); Mahmood, Kashif (Bahria University)",34,13,1.26,16.48,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/16/3/508/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112067840,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

In radiology, this includes picture archive and communication systems, radiology information systems, speech recognition systems, and other ancillary systems. Hospital information technology (IT) departments are required to provide 24âÃâ7 support for these mission-critical systems that directly support patient care in emergency and other critical care departments. The practical know-how to keep these systems operational and diagnose problems promptly is difficult to maintain around the clock. Specific details on infrequent failure modes or advanced troubleshooting strategies may reside with only a few senior staff members. Our goal was to reduce diagnosis and recovery times for issues with our mission-critical systems. We created a knowledge base for building and quickly disseminating technical expertise to our entire support staff. We used an open source, wiki-based, collaborative authoring system internally within our IT department to improve our ability to deliver a high level of service to our customers. In this paper, we describe our evaluation of the wiki and the ways in which we used it to organize our support knowledge.

BACKGROUND: Health science research has traditionally focused on knowledge transfer and research evidence instead of knowledge management, culture and organisational learning. Systematic reviews indicate a lack of awareness about nurse leaders' activities in knowledge management.
DESIGN: Qualitative interview study according to the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (see Supporting Information TableÂ S1).
METHODS: Data were collected at a Finnish public, social and healthcare organisation from 33 persons in 2015 and 2017 through 35 individual interviews and seven focus groups. Data were analysed by thematic analysis.
RESULTS: Nurse leaders' daily knowledge management activities included assurance of smooth work functions and decisions about sudden changes. When managing knowledge promotion, nurse leaders focused on the near future and served information providers, coaches and developers of operating culture. Anticipatory management of knowledge requirements emphasised nurse leaders' roles as assessors and visionaries. Tensions while managing knowledge were related to the following: changes in clients' service needs, insufficient structures and tools to support the assessment and joint development of competence, time and information management, the operating culture, and nurse leader support. Participants reported only few attempts to solve tensions and therefore little to no transformative agency.
CONCLUSION: Nurse leaders prioritised daily knowledge management over management of knowledge promotion and anticipatory management of knowledge requirements. Knowledge management in nursing is a complex task requiring a command of different kinds of agency and related leadership styles. The structures, processes and tools supporting knowledge management should be developed to ensure that activities are systematic.
RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A description of nurse leaders' perceptions of and experiences with knowledge management could improve recognition of nurse leaders' agencies for knowledge management, identification of related tensions and application of lessons learned from tensions. This description could also promote nurses' professional competence and supplement nurse leaders' training.",CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.,"Funding Information The research was funded by The Finnish Nurses Association, Akava Association of Nurses and Health Science Academic Leaders and Experts Taja, the City of Helsinki's Social and Health Services, and Government Grants for Health Science Research.",Journal of Clinical Nursing,,Adult; Female; Finland; Focus Groups; Humans; Knowledge Management; Leadership; Male; Nurse Administrators; Organizational Culture; Qualitative Research,2018-11-08,2018,2018-11-08,2019-03,28,5-6,969-979,Closed,Article,"Lunden, Anne; TerÃ¤s, Marianne; Kvist, Tarja; HÃ¤ggmanâLaitila, Arja","Lunden, Anne (Department of Social Services and Health Care, City of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Department of Nursing Science, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland); TerÃ¤s, Marianne (Department of Education, Stockholm University, University of Stockholm, Stockholm, Sweden); Kvist, Tarja (Department of Nursing Science, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland); HÃ¤ggmanâLaitila, Arja (Department of Social Services and Health Care, City of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland; Department of Nursing Science, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland)","Lunden, Anne (; University of Eastern Finland)","Lunden, Anne (University of Eastern Finland); TerÃ¤s, Marianne (Stockholm University); Kvist, Tarja (University of Eastern Finland); HÃ¤ggmanâLaitila, Arja (University of Eastern Finland)",10,8,1.24,3.33,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107796253,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

Hospitals are complex organizations with unique characteristics because of the heterogeneity of health professionals' orientation, the composite networking and the decision-making processes. A deeper understanding of knowledge management (KM) could streamline productivity and coordinate the use of resources more efficient. We conducted a systematic literature search of peer-reviewed papers that described key elements of KM using three databases (Medline, Cinahl and Health Source: nursing/academic edition) for a 10-year period (1/1/2004-25/11/2014). The included articles were subjected to qualitative content analysis. We retrieved 604 articles of which 20 articles were eligible for analysis. Most of the studies (n=13) used a qualitative methodology. The total sample size was 2155 participants. The key elements that arose were as follows: perceptions of KM, synthesis, dissemination, collaboration, means of KM and leadership. Moreover, this study identified barriers for KM implementation, like time restrictions and limited skills. Healthcare managers ought to cultivate a knowledge environment, operate as role models, provide the tools for KM and reward people who act as knowledge brokers. Opportunities for collaboration and knowledge sharing should be encouraged. Successful KM should be patient-centered to gain its maximum value.

Due to the important role that it plays towards successful implementation of Quality by Design (QbD), an analysis of KM solutions is needed. This work provides a comprehensive review of the interface between KM and QbD-driven biopharmaceutical production systems as perceived by academic as well as industrial viewpoints. A comprehensive set of 356 publications addressing the applications of KM tools to QbD-related tasks were screened and a query to gather industrial inputs from 17 major biopharmaceutical organizations was performed. Three KM tool classes were identified as having high relevance for biopharmaceutical production systems and have been further explored: knowledge indicators, ontologies, and process modeling. A proposed categorization of 16 distinct KM tool classes allowed for the identification of holistic technologies supporting QbD. In addition, the classification allowed for addressing the disparity between industrial and academic expectations regarding the application of KM methodologies. This is a first of a kind attempt and thus we think that this paper would be of considerable interest to those in academia and industry that are engaged in accelerating development and commercialization of biopharmaceuticals.",Financial support was provided by the Austrian research funding association (FFG) under the scope of the COMET program within the research project âIndustrial Methods for Process Analytical Chemistry - From Measurement Technologies to Information Systems (imPACts)â (contract # 843546).

We conducted a review to better understand the nature of these portals and their contribution to knowledge management in public health, with the aim of informing future development of portals in this field.MethodsA systematic literature search was conducted of the peer-reviewed and grey literature to identify articles that described the design, development or evaluation of Knowledge Exchange Portals KEPs in the public health field. The content of the articles was analysed, interpreted and synthesised in light of the objectives of the review.ResultsThe systematic search yielded 2223 articles, of which fifteen were deemed eligible for review, including eight case studies, six evaluation studies and one commentary article. Knowledge exchange portals mainly included design features to support knowledge access and creation, but formative evaluation studies examining user needs suggested collaborative features supporting knowledge exchange would also be useful. Overall web usage statistics revealed increasing use of some of these portals over time; however difficulties remain in retaining users. There is some evidence to suggest that the use of a knowledge exchange portal in combination with tailored and targeted messaging can increase the use of evidence in policy and program decision making at the organisational level.ConclusionsKnowledge exchange portals can be a platform for providing integrated access to relevant content and resources in one location, for sharing and distributing information and for bringing people together for knowledge exchange. However more performance evaluation studies are needed to determine how they can best support evidence-informed decision making in public health.","The first author was employed as part of the NSW Public Health Officer Training Program, funded by the NSW Ministry of Health.

The main goal of this system is to facilitate decision-making processes, while developing skills and creating new medical knowledge. Traditional Chinese Medicine can be considered as an ancient relational knowledge-based approach, focusing on balancing interrelated human functions to reach a healthy state. Western Medicine focuses on specialties and body systems and has achieved advanced methods to evaluate the impact of a health disorder on the body functions. Identifying key relationships between Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine opens new approaches for health care practices and can increase the understanding of human medical conditions. Our knowledge management system was designed from initial datasets of symptoms, known diagnosis and treatments, collected from both medicines. The datasets were subjected to process-oriented analysis, hierarchical knowledge representation and relational database interconnection. Web technology was implemented to develop a user-friendly interface, for easy navigation, training and research. Our system was prototyped with a case study on chronic prostatitis. This trial presented the system's capability for users to learn the correlation approach, connecting knowledge in Western and Traditional Chinese Medicine by querying the database, mapping validated medical information, accessing complementary information from official sites, and creating new knowledge as part of the learning process. By addressing the challenging tasks of data acquisition and modeling, organization, storage and transfer, the proposed web-based knowledge management system is presented as a tool for users in medical training and research to explore, learn and update relational information for the practice of integrated medical diagnosis. This proposal in education has the potential to enable further creation of medical knowledge from both Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine for improved care providing. The presented system positively improves the information visualization, learning process and knowledge sharing, for training and development of new skills for diagnosis and treatment, and a better understanding of medical diseases.","The authors would like to thank the members of the Computer Graphics and Design Research Group, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Florida.

The review revealed that healthcare, business, and global virtual knowledge platforms have been developed to elicit certain behaviors in users. For those who develop virtual knowledge platforms, the results are improved efficiency, innovation, accessibility, and cost savings. The main component of virtual knowledge platforms is a central repository or an infrastructure where knowledge is created, acquired, stored (documents), updated, and shared internally and externally. The refinery processes refer to technology mechanisms that make content accessible. A transparent collaboration among information technology, knowledge owners, and users is needed to successfully sustain a virtual knowledge platform.

In data-driven analyses of manufacturing data, we observed a discrepancy between two stakeholder groups involved in serial manufacturing processes: Knowledge providers (e.g., engineers) have domain knowledge about the manufacturing process but have difficulties in implementing data-driven analyses. Knowledge consumers (e.g., data scientists) have no first-hand domain knowledge but are highly skilled in performing data-driven analyses. ManuKnowVis bridges the gap between providers and consumers and enables the creation and completion of manufacturing knowledge. We contribute a multi-stakeholder design study, where we developed ManuKnowVis in three main iterations with consumers and providers from an automotive company. The iterative development led us to a multiple linked view tool, in which, on the one hand, providers can describe and connect individual entities (e.g., stations or produced parts) of the manufacturing process based on their domain knowledge. On the other hand, consumers can leverage this enhanced data to better understand complex domain problems, thus, performing data analyses more efficiently. As such, our approach directly impacts the success of data-driven analyses from manufacturing data. To demonstrate the usefulness of our approach, we carried out a case study with seven domain experts, which demonstrates how providers can externalize their knowledge and consumers can implement data-driven analyses more efficiently.",,,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,,,2023-06-19,2023,2023-06-19,2023-06-19,PP,99,1-13,Closed,Article,"Eirich, Joscha; JÃ¤ckle, Dominik; Sedlmair, Michael; Wehner, Christoph; Schmid, Ute; Bernard, JÃ¼rgen; Schreck, Tobias","Eirich, Joscha (University of Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany); JÃ¤ckle, Dominik (BMW Group, Munich, Germany); Sedlmair, Michael (University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany); Wehner, Christoph (University of Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany); Schmid, Ute (University of Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany); Bernard, JÃ¼rgen (UZH Digital Socienty Initiative (DSI), University of Zurich, Z&#x00FC;rich, Switzerland); Schreck, Tobias (Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria)",,"Eirich, Joscha (University of Bamberg); JÃ¤ckle, Dominik (BMW Group (Germany)); Sedlmair, Michael (University of Stuttgart); Wehner, Christoph (University of Bamberg); Schmid, Ute (University of Bamberg); Bernard, JÃ¼rgen (University of Zurich); Schreck, Tobias (Graz University of Technology)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1159937571,46 Information and Computing Sciences,

Drawing on the literature-based view and the vector error-correction model, this study attempts to examine the effects of COVID-19 related factors on companies that provide or share access to goods and services that are facilitated by a community-based online platform. We argue that the government response, and the testing policy and contact tracing will promote managers to adjust their business model. In the long term, economic support, such as income support and debt relief, will reduce stuffsâ motivation to work, leading to less achievements. On the other hand, due to the strictness of policies, people will increase online activities and stimulate the sharing economy. Using Indxx data and the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker database, the analysis of time series data from 75 U.S.-listed companies provides supports for both the short-run effects of the lockdown restrictions and closures with measures, and the government response, and the long-run effects of economic support, and the strictness of lockdown-style policies.

Especially for enterprises with high dependence on knowledge resources, employees' innovation and knowledge sharing play a vital role. In the context of global economic austerity, how to put forward the corresponding plan of knowledge sharing intention to improve the knowledge sharing behavior of employees for enterprises is worth discussing. Mainland China and Malaysia have different quarantine policies and similar industrial structures. This study examines the awareness of Mainland China vs. Malaysian employees, and evaluates the relationship among self-efficacy, job security, market orientation, knowledge sharing intention, and knowledge sharing behavior from the theory of planned behavior. In this study, a total of 627 Mainland China and 434 Malaysian participants were collected to compare both groups in the development of employees' knowledge sharing behavior. In this study, a variance-based partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was performed to test the proposed hypothesis and conduct comparative analysis. The results in both the samples show that self-efficacy, job security, and market orientation have positive and significant effects on knowledge sharing intention; self-efficacy has positive and significant effects on job security; knowledge sharing intention has positive and significant effects on knowledge sharing behavior.

This calls for systematic learning to guide future trials and policies by standardizing and automating the QT analyses to improve review efficiency, provide consistent advice, and enable pooled data analyses to answer key regulatory questions. The QT interval represents the time from initiation of ventricular depolarization to completion of ventricular repolarization recorded by electrocardiograph (ECG) and is used in the proarrhythmic risk assessment. The developed QT knowledge management system is implemented in the R package ""QT."" Data from 11 crossover TQT studies including time-matched ECGs and pharmacokinetic measurements following single doses of 400 to 1200 mg moxifloxacin were used for the QT analysis example. The automated workflow was divided into 3 components (data management, analysis, and archival). The generated data sets, scripts, tables, and graphs are automatically stored in a queryable repository and summarized in an analysis report. More than 100 TQT studies have been analyzed using the system since 2007. This has dramatically reduced the time needed to review TQT studies and has made the IRT-QT reviews consistent across reviewers.

This paper concerns knowledge, not only from an epistemological point of view, but also from a pragmatic one. In our paper, knowledge is discussed as the hub to promote better decision making and continuous professional development. Effective thinking is particularly needed. The critical point is to think about how health care systems can develop both an effective knowledge management network and how health-care organizations can actually be based on it. In this way, knowledge and knowledge hierarchy are defined according to Russel Achkoffâs vision. Generally, knowledge is crucial in decision-making, and Evidence-Based Medicine has its roots in knowledge. In particular, information management is the basis for a significant production of knowledge to promote good health-care decision-making. Thus, relationships between knowledge management and Evidence-Based Medicine are discussed, and a new paradigm is proposed: the Evidence-Based Knowledge Management. Finally, the role of Evidence-Based Knowledge Management within Clinical Governance is discussed together with some considerations about clinical governance implementation problems in Italy.",We thank Emanuela Martella and Paola Martorana for language revision of this manuscript.

There was need to identify AMREF's current Knowledge Management implementation status, problems and constraints encountered after two years of enforcement of the strategy and suggest the way forward.
METHODS: This study was conducted between October 2011 and February 2012. Quantitative data on number and foci of AMREF research publications were collected using a questionnaire. Focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were used to gather data on explanations for the trend of publications and the status of the implementation of the 2010-2014 Knowledge Management Strategy. Quantitative data was analysed using SPSS computer software whereas content analysis of themes was employed on qualitative data.
RESULTS: Between 1960 and 2011, AMREF produced 257 peer reviewed publications, 158 books and manuals and about 1,188 technical publications including evaluations, guidelines and technical reports. However, the numbers of publications declined from around the year 2000. Large quantities of unpublished and unclassified materials are also in the custody of Heritage. Barriers to Knowledge Management included: lack of incentives for documentation and dissemination; limited documentation and use of good practices in programming; and superficial attention to results or use of evidence.
CONCLUSION: Alternative ways of reorganizing Knowledge Management will enable AMREF to use evidence-based knowledge to advocate for appropriate changes in African health policies and practices.",AcknowledgementsWe wish to acknowledge the Knowledge Management Core Group at AMREF for their valuable contribution to the development of this paper.,,Pan African Medical Journal,,"Africa; Data Collection; Documentation; Evidence-Based Medicine; Focus Groups; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Policy; Humans; Knowledge Management; Publications; Research; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors",2012-12-25,2012,2012-12-25,2012,13 Suppl 1,Suppl 1,3,Closed,Article,"Shoo, Rumishael; Matuku, Willy; Ireri, Jane; Nyagero, Josephat; Gatonga, Patrick","Shoo, Rumishael (African Medical and Research Foundation, Nairobi, Kenya); Matuku, Willy (African Medical and Research Foundation, Nairobi, Kenya); Ireri, Jane (African Medical and Research Foundation, Nairobi, Kenya); Nyagero, Josephat (African Medical and Research Foundation, Nairobi, Kenya); Gatonga, Patrick (African Medical and Research Foundation, Nairobi, Kenya)",,"Shoo, Rumishael (Amref Health Africa); Matuku, Willy (Amref Health Africa); Ireri, Jane (Amref Health Africa); Nyagero, Josephat (Amref Health Africa); Gatonga, Patrick (Amref Health Africa)",4,1,0.06,0.82,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1078699163,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Both qualitative and quantitative research were used in this study. The instrument was conducted using in-depth interviews of three policy-makers as participants. The quantitative data were collected from a regional hospital in the Northern part of Taiwan with a 77 percent effective response rate (n=154).
FINDINGS: The findings in this paper indicate that the cognition and demand for KM in subordinates is close to the expectations of policy-makers. The policy-makers expect subordinates working in the hospital to be brave in taking on new responsibilities and complying with hospital operation norms. KM is emphasized as a powerful and positive asset. Moreover, understanding KM predicts good performance in an organization.
RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The findings in this paper can be generalized to other regional hospitals. The findings may be applied to a wider population.
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This study can provide insights into the perceptions and cognitions of workers in a hospital about KM and the activities of KM enablers. The responses and perceptions observed in the interviews in this study, as well as the quantitative research results could be useful to other hospitals and individuals who engage KM as a new management trend.

The purpose of this paper is to outline the contribution of KM process to the social- and economic-related outcomes in the context of health organizations. Given the theoretical approach on the considered concepts and their relationships, a conceptual model and seven research hypotheses were proposed. The empirical data were provided by a cross-sectional investigation including 459 medical and nonmedical employees of Romanian heath organizations, selected by a mixed method sampling procedure. A partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach was selected to provide information on the relevance and significance of the first- and second-order constructs, test the hypotheses, and conduct an importance performance matrix analysis. The PLS-SEM estimation showed positive and significant relationships between KM process and quality of healthcare, and organizational-level social and economic outcomes. Moreover, the research results provided evidences for the complex complementary mediation of the quality of healthcare and social-related outcomes on the relationships between KM process and social and economic outcomes. The theoretical and managerial implications are discussed and suggestions for future research are provided at the end of the paper.","This study was partially conducted through the postdoctoral advanced research program, management field, coordinator the Bucharest University of Economic Studies.

With such growth, effective leadership, knowledge management, and quality programs can ameliorate patient safety outcomes and improve organizational performance.
PURPOSES: This exploratory study examines the efficacy of transformational leadership, knowledge management, and quality initiatives, each of which has been proven effective in health care organizations. The literature has neglected the relationships among these three types of programs, although they are increasingly implemented simultaneously now. This research tests the degree to which knowledge management could act as a mediator of the effects transformational leadership and quality management have on organizational performance for hospitals.
METHODOLOGY: Our survey of U.S. hospitals utilizes validated scales from the literature. By calling and e-mailing quality and other department directors, the data set includes responses from all 50 states in our sample of 370 U.S. hospitals. Statistical tests confirmed acceptable regional distribution, interrater reliability, and control variable characteristics for our sample. Structural equation modeling is used to test the research hypotheses.
FINDINGS: These preliminary results reveal that transformational leadership and quality management improve knowledge management. In addition, transformational leadership is fully mediated by knowledge responsiveness and quality management is partially mediated by knowledge responsiveness for their effects on organizational performance.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: The unique contribution of this study includes the suggestion that greater transformational leadership skills are important for health care executives to motivate successful knowledge management initiatives. Secondly, continuous improvements in quality management programs have significant positive impacts on knowledge management and organizational outcomes in hospitals. Finally, successful knowledge management initiatives are more closely tied to patient and organizational outcomes through the enhancement of knowledge responsiveness than by knowledge acquisition and dissemination alone.",,,Health Care Management Review,,"Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Diffusion of Innovation; Health Care Surveys; Health Services Research; Hospital Information Systems; Humans; Institutional Management Teams; Leadership; Models, Theoretical; Organizational Innovation; Total Quality Management; United States",2009-04,2009,,2009-04,34,2,129-140,Closed,Article,"Gowen, Charles R.; Henagan, Stephanie C.; McFadden, Kathleen L.","Gowen, Charles R.

METHODS: Analyze the potential of exploiting knowledge management technology in medicine.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The increasing pressure on HCOs to ensure efficiency and cost-effectiveness, balance the quality of care, and contain costs will drive them towards more effective management of medical knowledge derived from biomedical research. Knowledge management technology may provide effective methods and tools in speeding up the diffusion of innovative medical procedures. Reviews of the effectiveness of various methods of best practice dissemination show that the greatest impact is achieved when such knowledge is made accessible through the health information system at the moment it is required by care providers at their work sites. There is a need to take a more clinical process view of health care delivery and to identify the appropriate organizational and information infrastructures to support medical work. Thus, the great challenge for medical informatics is represented by the effective exploitation of the astonishing capabilities of new technologies to assure the conditions of knowledge management and organizational learning within HCOs.",,,Methods of Information in Medicine,,"Decision Making, Computer-Assisted; Evidence-Based Medicine; Health Facility Administration; Humans; Information Management; Patient Care Management; Practice Guidelines as Topic",2002,2002,2018-02-07,2002,41,01,36-43,Closed,Article,"Stefanelli, M","Stefanelli, M (Dipartimento di Informatica e Sistemistica, UniversitÃ¡; di Pavia, Italy. mstefa@aim.unipv.it)",,"Stefanelli, M (University of Pavia)",20,0,0.76,4.41,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1075026493,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being

This paper proposes a knowledge management approach that will enable the intelligent use of corporate experience and information and help to improve the selection of construction methods for a project. Then a knowledge-based system to support this decision-making process is proposed and described. To define and design the system, semistructured interviews were conducted within three construction companies with the purpose of studying the way that the method' selection process is carried out in practice and the knowledge associated with it. A prototype of a Construction Methods Knowledge System (CMKS) was developed and then validated with construction industry professionals. As a conclusion, the CMKS was perceived as a valuable tool for construction methods' selection, by helping companies to generate a corporate memory on this issue, reducing the reliance on individual knowledge and also the subjectivity of the decision-making process.

These activates are carried out by two types of knowledge in the organization called explicit and implicit knowledge. Among these, implicit knowledge is the knowledge that controls a major part of the activities of an organization, controls these activities internally and will not be transferred to the process owners unless they are present during the organization's work. Therefore the goal of this study is identification of implicit knowledge and its integration with explicit knowledge in order to improve human resources management, physical resource management, information resource management, training of new employees and other activities of Isfahan University of Medical Science.
METHODS: The project for documentation of activities in department of health of Isfahan University of Medical Science was carried out in several stages. First the main processes and related sub processes were identified and categorized with the help of planning expert. The categorization was carried out from smaller processes to larger ones. In this stage the experts of each process wrote down all their daily activities and organized them into general categories based on logical and physical relations between different activities. Then each activity was assigned a specific code. The computer software was designed after understanding the different parts of the processes, including main and sup processes, and categorization, which will be explained in the following sections.
RESULTS: The findings of this study showed that documentation of activities can help expose implicit knowledge because all of inputs and outputs of a process along with the length, location, tools and different stages of the process, exchanged information, storage location of the information and information flow can be identified using proper documentation.
CONCLUSION: A documentation program can create a complete identifier for every process of an organization and also acts as the main tool for establishment of information technology as the basis of the organization and helps achieve the goal of having electronic and information technology based organizations. In other words documentation is the starting step in creating an organizational architecture. Afterwards, in order to reach the desired goal of documentation, computer software containing all tools, methods, instructions and guidelines and implicit knowledge of the organization was designed. This software links all relevant knowledge to the main text of the documentation and identification of a process and provides the users with electronic versions of all documentations and helps use the explicit and implicit knowledge of the organization to facilitate the reengineering of the processes in the organization.",,,Materia Socio Medica,,,2015-10-05,2015,2015-10-05,2015,27,5,347-350,All OA; Green,Article,"Haddadpoor, Asefeh; Taheri, Behjat; Nasri, Mehran; Heydari, Kamal; Bahrami, Gholamreza","Haddadpoor, Asefeh (Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran); Taheri, Behjat (Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran); Nasri, Mehran (Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran); Heydari, Kamal (Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran); Bahrami, Gholamreza (Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran)","Taheri, Behjat (Isfahan University of Medical Sciences)","Haddadpoor, Asefeh (Isfahan University of Medical Sciences); Taheri, Behjat (Isfahan University of Medical Sciences); Nasri, Mehran (Isfahan University of Medical Sciences); Heydari, Kamal (Isfahan University of Medical Sciences); Bahrami, Gholamreza (Isfahan University of Medical Sciences)",0,0,,0.0,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4639364?pdf=render,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030140350,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,

                  Culture change represents an organizational transformational process to become person-centered, through staff and resident empowerment. Culture change initiatives have been associated with fewer health-related deficiency citations and better psychosocial outcomes. Knowledge management, defined as the process of creating or locating knowledge, and managing the dissemination of knowledge within and between organizations, has been shown to be associated with the adoption of innovations such as culture change initiatives. This study examines the relationship between knowledge management activities of high Medicaid census (70% or higher) nursing homes (NHs) and the adoption of culture change initiatives. This study used facility survey data from approximately 324 nursing home administrators (30% response rate) from 2017- 2018, merged with data from LTCFocus, Area Health Resource File, and Medicare Cost Reports. Binary logistic regression models revealed that the probability of adopting a culture change initiative was 0.12 higher for facilities reporting a one-unit higher level of knowledge management activities. Additional interaction analysis revealed that knowledge management activities were associated with a greater likelihood of adopting a culture change initiative for NHs where the director had been in his/her position fewer years. Similarly, higher levels of overall knowledge management activities were significantly associated with greater adoption of culture change initiatives at intermediate levels of nurse retention. Results suggest that knowledge management activities may help high Medicaid NHs acquire and mobilize informational resources in ways that can support the adoption of patient-centered initiatives. These activities may be particularly effective in nursing homes with leadership and nursing staff instability.",,,Innovation in Aging,,,2019-11-08,2019,2019-11-08,2019-11-08,3,Supplement_1,s697-s698,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hearld, Larry; Ghiasi, Akbar; Szychowski, Jeffery; Weech-Maldonado, Robert","Hearld, Larry (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States); Ghiasi, Akbar (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States); Szychowski, Jeffery (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States); Weech-Maldonado, Robert (University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, United States)",,"Hearld, Larry (University of Alabama at Birmingham); Ghiasi, Akbar (University of Alabama at Birmingham); Szychowski, Jeffery (University of Alabama at Birmingham); Weech-Maldonado, Robert (University of Alabama at Birmingham)",0,0,,0.0,https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article-pdf/3/Supplement_1/S697/33008466/igz038.2568.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1122418855,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

This paper proposes a new methodology for the sharing of construction knowledge by using Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology. The main characteristics of BIM include illustrating 3D CAD-based presentations and keeping information in a digital format and facilitation of easy updating and transfer of information in the BIM environment. Using the BIM technology, project managers and engineers can gain knowledge related to BIM and obtain feedback provided by jobsite engineers for future reference. This study addresses the application of knowledge sharing management using BIM technology and proposes a BIM-based Knowledge Sharing Management (BIMKSM) system for project managers and engineers. The BIMKSM system is then applied in a selected case study of a construction project in Taiwan to demonstrate the effectiveness of sharing knowledge in the BIM environment. The results demonstrate that the BIMKSM system can be used as a visual BIM-based knowledge sharing management platform by utilizing the BIM technology.","The authors would like to express their appreciation to S-D Construction Inc. for assistance in the system design and interviews and to the experts and engineers of the owner of the project for providing useful data, valuable information, and helpful comments during system design and development.",,The Scientific World JOURNAL,,Computer-Aided Design; Construction Industry; Engineering; Information Dissemination; Information Management; Planning Techniques; Problem Solving; Software; Taiwan; Time Factors,2013-11-07,2013,2013-11-07,2013,2013,,170498,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ho, Shih-Ping; Tserng, Hui-Ping; Jan, Shu-Hui","Ho, Shih-Ping (Department of Civil Engineering, National Taiwan University, Number 1, Setion 4, Taipei 10617, Taiwan); Tserng, Hui-Ping (Department of Civil Engineering, National Taiwan University, Number 1, Setion 4, Taipei 10617, Taiwan); Jan, Shu-Hui (Department of Civil Engineering, National Taiwan University, Number 1, Setion 4, Taipei 10617, Taiwan)","Jan, Shu-Hui (National Taiwan University)","Ho, Shih-Ping (National Taiwan University); Tserng, Hui-Ping (National Taiwan University); Jan, Shu-Hui (National Taiwan University)",43,12,,11.35,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2013/170498.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1046531278,33 Built Environment and Design; 3302 Building; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering,

This case study research approach was considered to provide a fine-grained approach recommended for improved understanding of nuances, detail, and the forces underlying the phenomena under observation. Focus on detail was an important attribute of this study notwithstanding possible shortcomings in not being able to externalize the research findings. Of the four modes of knowledge exchange observed to take place in this public hospital community of practice, Mode C (tacit to explicit) stands out as a key finding. Here, the release of each individual's tacit knowledge is forthcoming and free flowing given the established culture of trust in this clinic. The informal communication environment in the luminal space of their workplace corridor provided a conducive environment that enabled a free-flowing exchange of community knowledge.

We analyse here the findings of a critical review of generic management and health-related literatures, covering the period 2000-2008. Using 29 pre-selected journals, supplemented by a search of selected electronic databases, we map twelve substantive domains classified into four broad groups: taxonomic and philosophical (e.g. different types of knowledge); theoretical discourse (e.g. critical organisational studies); disciplinary fields (e.g. organisational learning and Information Systems/Information Technology); and organisational processes and structures (e.g. organisational form). We explore cross-overs and gaps between these traditionally separate literature streams. We found that health sector literature has absorbed some generic concepts, notably Communities of Practice, but has not yet deployed the performance-oriented perspective of the Resource Based View (RBV) of the Firm. The generic literature uses healthcare sites to develop critical analyses of power and control in knowledge management, rooted in neo-Marxist/labour process and Foucauldian approaches. The review generates three theoretically grounded statements to inform future enquiry, by: (a) importing the RBV stream; (b) developing the critical organisational studies perspective further; and (c) exploring the theoretical argument that networks and other alternative organisational forms facilitate knowledge sharing.",The authors acknowledge the support of the UK National Institute of Health Research Service Delivery and Organisation Programme.

We have recently begun investigating smaller, community hospitals and out-patient clinics that rely on commercially-available EHRs. We sought to assess whether the current generation of commercially-available EHRs are capable of providing the clinical knowledge management features, functions, tools, and techniques required to deliver and maintain the clinical decision support (CDS) interventions required to support the recently defined ""meaningful use"" criteria.MethodsWe developed and fielded a 17-question survey to representatives from nine commercially available EHR vendors and four leading internally developed EHRs. The first part of the survey asked basic questions about the vendor's EHR. The second part asked specifically about the CDS-related system tools and capabilities that each vendor provides. The final section asked about clinical content.ResultsAll of the vendors and institutions have multiple modules capable of providing clinical decision support interventions to clinicians. The majority of the systems were capable of performing almost all of the key knowledge management functions we identified.ConclusionIf these well-designed commercially-available systems are coupled with the other key socio-technical concepts required for safe and effective EHR implementation and use, and organizations have access to implementable clinical knowledge, we expect that the transformation of the healthcare enterprise that so many have predicted, is achievable using commercially-available, state-of-the-art EHRs.","We would like to thank Justin Barnes, Emily Bowman, Sarah Corley, Shailja Dixit, Chuck Frederick, Melissa Honour, James Ingram, Jacob Reider, Jack Smyth, and Sean Thomas for helping us complete the vendor surveys.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey design was employed. The study population consisted of African health sciences librarians that attended the 16th Biennial Conference of the Association for Health Information and Libraries in Africa on October 14-18, 2019, at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria. Data were collected using a questionnaire and analyzed using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: The types of knowledge most commonly shared by respondents were information on conferences, workshops, and seminars as well as information on new trends and technologies in librarianship. The main avenue of knowledge sharing was face-to-face interaction. Unwillingness to share knowledge and a lack of awareness about current trends and issues were the top identified challenges to knowledge sharing.
CONCLUSION: These survey results establish the existence of a low level of knowledge sharing among health science librarians in Africa and suggest that concerted efforts should be made to overcome barriers to knowledge sharing within and across African countries.",,,Journal of the Medical Library Association,,"Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Librarians; Libraries, Medical; Library Science; Surveys and Questionnaires",2021-10-01,2021,2021-11-22,2021-10-01,109,4,624â630-624â630,All OA; Gold,Article,"Olayemi, Olalekan Moses; Olayemi, Kemi Jummai","Olayemi, Olalekan Moses (Senior Librarian, Library and Information Technology Department, Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Lagos, Nigeria); Olayemi, Kemi Jummai (Librarian, Bayero University Kano, Kano, Nigeria)",,"Olayemi, Olalekan Moses (Nigerian Institute of Medical Research); Olayemi, Kemi Jummai (Bayero University Kano)",0,0,,0.0,https://jmla.pitt.edu/ojs/jmla/article/download/1183/1376,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143422364,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4610 Library and Information Studies,

A comparative analysis of measurement tools for organisational context,"BackgroundGiven the current emphasis on networks as vehicles for innovation and change in health service delivery, the ability to conceptualise and measure organisational enablers for the social construction of knowledge merits attention. This study aimed to develop a composite tool to measure the organisational context for evidence-based practice (EBP) in healthcare.MethodsA structured search of the major healthcare and management databases for measurement tools from four domains: research utilisation (RU), research activity (RA), knowledge management (KM), and organisational learning (OL). Included studies were reports of the development or use of measurement tools that included organisational factors. Tools were appraised for face and content validity, plus development and testing methods. Measurement tool items were extracted, merged across the four domains, and categorised within a constructed framework describing the absorptive and receptive capacities of organisations.ResultsThirty measurement tools were identified and appraised. Eighteen tools from the four domains were selected for item extraction and analysis. The constructed framework consists of seven categories relating to three core organisational attributes of vision, leadership, and a learning culture, and four stages of knowledge need, acquisition of new knowledge, knowledge sharing, and knowledge use. Measurement tools from RA or RU domains had more items relating to the categories of leadership, and acquisition of new knowledge; while tools from KM or learning organisation domains had more items relating to vision, learning culture, knowledge need, and knowledge sharing. There was equal emphasis on knowledge use in the different domains.ConclusionIf the translation of evidence into knowledge is viewed as socially mediated, tools to measure the organisational context of EBP in healthcare could be enhanced by consideration of related concepts from the organisational and management sciences. Comparison of measurement tools across domains suggests that there is scope within EBP for supplementing the current emphasis on human and technical resources to support information uptake and use by individuals. Consideration of measurement tools from the fields of KM and OL shows more content related to social mechanisms to facilitate knowledge recognition, translation, and transfer between individuals and groups.",We wish to acknowledge the support of the North West Strategic Health Authority for funding the continuation of this work into the development and piloting of a benchmark tool for the organisational context of EBP.,,Implementation Science,,,2009-05-19,2009,2009-05-19,2009-12,4,1,28,All OA; Gold,Article,"French, Beverley; Thomas, Lois H; Baker, Paula; Burton, Christopher R; Pennington, Lindsay; Roddam, Hazel","French, Beverley (School of Nursing and Caring Sciences, University of Central Lancashire, PR1 2HE, Preston, Lancashire, England, UK); Thomas, Lois H (School of Nursing and Caring Sciences, University of Central Lancashire, PR1 2HE, Preston, Lancashire, England, UK); Baker, Paula (Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, North Manchester General Hospital, M8 5RB, Manchester, England, UK); Burton, Christopher R (Centre for Health-Related Research, School of Healthcare Sciences, College of Health and Behavioural Sciences, Bangor University, LL57 2EF, Gwynedd, Wales, UK); Pennington, Lindsay (School of Clinical Medical Sciences (Child Health), University of Newcastle, Sir James Spence Institute, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Queen Victoria Road, NE1 4LP, Newcastle upon Tyne, England, UK); Roddam, Hazel (School of Public Health and Clinical Sciences, University of Central Lancashire, PR1 2HE, Preston, Lancashire, England, UK)","French, Beverley (University of Central Lancashire)","French, Beverley (University of Central Lancashire); Thomas, Lois H (University of Central Lancashire); Baker, Paula (North Manchester General Hospital); Burton, Christopher R (Bangor University); Pennington, Lindsay (Royal Victoria Infirmary; Newcastle University); Roddam, Hazel (University of Central Lancashire)",57,2,1.91,,https://implementationscience.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1748-5908-4-28,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1030865368,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,

To explicate the relationship, this study examines the mediating role of self-serving behavior and moderating role of personal competitiveness.
Methods: To evaluate the relationships, a moderated-mediation model is devised and tested. Data is collected through a web-based questionnaire from 194 individuals employed in both manufacturing and service sector firms of Pakistan. Multiple statistical software packages are used to analyze the data.
Results: After employing several statistical techniques, the findings of the study suggest that self-serving behavior fully mediates the link between fear of losing power and knowledge hiding. Moreover, the result of two-way interaction reveals that personal competitiveness further amplifies the indirect relationship between fear of losing power and knowledge hiding through self-serving behavior.

However, many CSOs across Africalack the necessary capacity to perform this role robustly. This paper reports on an evaluation of the use, and perceived impact, of aknowledge management tool upon institutional strengthening among CSOs working in Kenya's health sector.
METHODS: Three methods were used: analytics data; user satisfaction surveys; and a furtherkey informant survey.
RESULTS: Satisfaction with the portal was consistently high, with 99% finding the quality and relevance of the content very good or good for institutional strengthening standards, governance, and planning and resource mobilisation. Critical facilitators to the success of knowledge management for CSO institutional strengthening were identified as people/culture (developed resources and organisational narratives) and technology (easily accessible, enabling information exchange, tools/resources available, access to consultants/partners). Critical barriers were identified as people/culture (database limitations, materials limitations, and lack of active users), and process (limited access, limited interactions, and limited approval process).
CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated the perceived utility of a web-based knowledge management portal among developing nations' CSOs, with widespread satisfaction across multiple domains, which increased over time. Providing increased opportunities for collective mutual learning, promoting a culture of data use for decision making, and encouraging all health organisations to be learning institutions should be a priority for those interested in promoting sustainable long-term solutions for Africa.","Funding was provided by the United States President&#x27;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) under Cooperative Agreement AID-623-A-11-00029.

Ideal KM combines different sources of knowledge to support innovation and improve performance.
PURPOSES: Despite the importance of KM in health care organizations (HCOs), there has been very little empirical research to describe KM in this context. This study explores KM in HCOs, focusing on the status of current intraorganizational KM. The intention is to provide insight for future studies and model development for effective KM implementation in HCOs.
METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A qualitative methods approach was used to create an empirically based model of KM in HCOs. Methods included (a) qualitative interviews (n = 24) with senior leadership to identify types of knowledge important in these roles plus current information-seeking behaviors/needs and (b) in-depth case study with leaders in new executive positions (n = 2). The data were collected from 10 HCOs. Our empirically based model for KM was assessed for face and content validity.
FINDINGS: The findings highlight the paucity of formal KM in our sample HCOs. Organizational culture, leadership, and resources are instrumental in supporting KM processes. An executive's knowledge needs are extensive, but knowledge assets are often limited or difficult to acquire as much of the available information is not in a usable format. We propose an empirically based model for KM to highlight the importance of context (internal and external), and knowledge seeking, synthesis, sharing, and organization. Participants who reviewed the model supported its basic components and processes, and potential for incorporating KM into organizational processes.
DISCUSSION: Our results articulate ways to improve KM, increase organizational learning, and support evidence-informed decision-making.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: This research has implications for how to better integrate evidence and knowledge into organizations while considering context and the role of organizational processes.",,,Health Care Management Review,,"Delivery of Health Care; Health Facility Administration; Interviews as Topic; Knowledge Management; Leadership; Models, Organizational; Organizational Culture; Organizational Innovation; Qualitative Research",2016-01,2016,,2016-01,41,1,64-74,Closed,Article,"Sibbald, Shannon L.; Wathen, C.

These IS outsourcing decisions are driven by multiple organisational factors such as outsource vendor expertise and knowledge, process performance improvement due to better IS, and enabling the organisationâs ability to focus on its core capabilities. In order to harnass such vendor knowledge to achieve business outcomes, the importance of a shared knowledge asset base, between the client organisation and outsource vendor, is emphasised. However, outcomes from IS outsourcing remain poor despite consideration of experience and research. Therefore, the aim of this study is to design and propose a knowledge asset management implementation framework that may be applied in IS outsourcing projects. The proposed framework was evaluated by an experienced programme director and its applicability was tested against a large scale IS outsourcing project. The purpose of such a framework is to enable organisations to manage and institutionalise knowledge assets that are created during the IS outsourcing project and to ensure that the organisation may gain the benefit from such knowledge assets as an outcome of the IS outsourcing arrangement.",,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,"Responsible Design, Implementation and Use of Information and Communication Technology",,2020-04-01,2020,2020-04-01,2020,12067,,274-286,All OA; Bronze,Chapter,"Smuts, Hanlie; Maramba, George","Smuts, Hanlie (Department of Informatics, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa); Maramba, George (Department of Informatics, University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa)","Smuts, Hanlie (University of Pretoria)","Smuts, Hanlie (University of Pretoria); Maramba, George (University of Pretoria)",0,0,,0.0,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-45002-1_23.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126171083,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,

METHODS: We used a self-administered questionnaire to survey Chief Information Officers at all 21 of New Zealand's District Health Boards regarding the extent to which their organisations use knowledge sharing activities involving ITs. The list of activities to include in the questionnaire was compiled by reviewing the literature. We analysed the extent of use of the knowledge sharing activities using descriptive statistics, repeated measures ANOVA, and correlation analysis.
RESULTS: The response rate was 76%. Although all the responding organisations reported using ITs to share knowledge, they used ITs to share documents significantly more than to support discussions or to connect employees to experts. Discussions via teleconferencing, videoconferencing, and email lists were significantly more common than discussions via social media technologies: electronic discussion forums, blogs, and on-line chatrooms. There were significant positive correlations between publishing and accessing documents, between using teleconferencing and using videoconferencing, and between publishing and finding contact details of experts.
CONCLUSION: New Zealand's District Health Boards are using a range of ITs to share knowledge. Knowledge sharing activities emphasising the sharing of explicit knowledge (via exchanging documents in electronic form) are significantly more common than knowledge sharing activities emphasising the sharing of tacit knowledge (via technology-mediated discussions and via using technology to connect employees to experts). In view of the evidence in the literature that information technology may be highly effective in supporting tacit knowledge exchanges, our results suggest that health organisations should consider greater adoption of ITs for sharing tacit knowledge. The finding that several organisations are currently making extensive use of teleconferencing and videoconferencing facilities and expertise databases suggests that these technologies are useful and could be of benefit to other healthcare providers and that barriers to their adoption can be overcome. In order to facilitate the wider adoption of technologies, early adopters of both relatively established technologies and of the emerging technologies such as social media should be encouraged to publish accounts of their experiences of success and lessons learnt from any failures so that the knowledge gained is disseminated to the wider medical informatics community.","We thank Chris Dever, Chairman of New Zealand&#x27;s DHBs CIO group, for providing the list of contacts of the CIOs, as well as the CIOs who took the time to respond to our questionnaire.

Finally, an analysis was conducted on data collected from a survey of top and midlevel managers at Iran's Ministry of Health and Medical Education covering knowledge sharing, its barriers, and solutions. More than 90% of managers believe that the most important barriers to implementing a KIS system are limitations brought about by specialized knowledge, a culture of independent working, nonstandard processes, and a lack of a proper system for KIS.

We argue that human-centered computing goes beyond a better user interface: it should include considerations of users, functions and tasks that are fundamental to human-centered computing. From this perspective, we integrated a previously developed human-centered methodology with a Project Design Lifecycle, and we applied this integration in the design of a complex distributed knowledge management system for the Biomedical Engineer (BME) domain in the Mission Control Center at NASA Johnson Space Center. We analyzed this complex system, identified its problems, generated systems requirements, and provided specifications of a replacement prototype for effective organizational memory and knowledge management.

However, existing measures for such organizational practices tend to capture the construct with unidimensional scales, use single-item operationalizations, or focus on a specific area. Hence, WÃ¶hrmann, Deller, and Pundt (2018) developed the Later Life Workplace Index (LLWI) to provide a multidimensional framework to measure organizational practices for older employees on nine dimensions, namely organizational climate, leadership, work design, health management, individual development, knowledge management, transition to retirement, continued employment after retirement, and health and retirement coverage. The LLWI has recently been operationalized and validated in Germany (Wilckens, WÃ¶hrmann, Deller, & Wang, 2020). However, to utilize the index beyond German-speaking countries, a validated English version is required. Thus, we aimed to validate an English version of the LLWI using a sample of older U.S. employees (N = 279). Results support the domain level factor structure of the LLWI but show some redundancy among the 80 items for the overall nine domain factor structure. A comparison between the U.S. sample and a German sample (N = 349) confirmed configural and (partial) metric measurement invariance of the English version. Results further supported convergent, discriminant, criterion, as well as incremental validity. Researchers can utilize the new measure to gain a deeper understanding of organizational practices relevant for older employees, while practitioners are able to assess their organizational readiness for an aging workforce.

The results demonstrate that there is very little literature that addresses the two themes together. The few papers found, however, can be said to show the many advantages of introducing sustainability policies supported by adequate knowledge management. Very little has been studied with regards to the role of workers, which could be interpreted as meaning that little importance is given to the proactive role they may play.

Our review presents two major findings. First, only limited work has been done in three EMIS-knowledge management system (KMS) subdomains: (i) definition, (ii) use, and (iii) methods. Second, only limited research has been done in embedding roles in KM systems. We highlight role alignment to the 12 fundamental roles, as called for by Turoff et al.

In this paper, we draw on the extensive experience of NHS (National Health Service) England to develop a practitioner perspective on the challenges of effectively implementing and sustaining such solutions. We argue that a properly sustainable approach requires a shift in both thinking and practice when it comes to the spread and adoption of such technologies. Our thinking needs to shift from a focus on the technology itself to how we bring about the changes needed to deliver more efficient and effective care for patients. In practical terms, this means focussing on the changes involved to integrate digital health solutions into the delivery of services. In particular, it requires greater attention to the motivations, constraints and specific contexts that influence users and patients. The technical expertise of innovators therefore needs to be complemented by other forms of insight into change processes, including clinical and behavioral insight, process engineering and knowledge management. In this paper, we show how these different pillars of the NHS Sustainable Healthcare approach help to ensure the effective implementation and use of digital solutions. We draw out the implications of this approach for policy-makers in healthcare systems, highlighting the need to give greater attention and resources to the downstream challenges of implementing digital health solutions.",,,Frontiers in Digital Health,,,2022-03-31,2022,2022-03-31,,4,,727421,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cripps, Matthew; Scarbrough, Harry","Cripps, Matthew (Sustainable Healthcare National Health Service (NHS) England, London, United Kingdom); Scarbrough, Harry (Centre for Healthcare Innovation Research, City, University of London, London, United Kingdom)","Scarbrough, Harry (University of London)","Cripps, Matthew (National Health Service England); Scarbrough, Harry (University of London)",8,8,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2022.727421/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146764965,42 Health Sciences; 4203 Health Services and Systems,3 Good Health and Well Being
1197,pub.1099599056,,29259938,PMC5734963,Knowledge Management Orientation: An Innovative Perspective to Hospital Management.,"BACKGROUND: By considering innovation as a new project in hospitals, all the project management's standard steps should be followed in execution. This study investigated the validation of a new set of measures in terms of providing a procedure for knowledge management-oriented innovation that enriches the hospital management system.
METHODS: The relation between innovation and all the knowledge management areas, as the main constructs of project management, was illustrated by referring to project management standard steps and previous studies. Through consultations and meetings with a committee of professional project managers, a questionnaire was developed to measure ten knowledge management areas in hospital's innovation process. Additionally, a group of experts from hospital managers were invited to comment on the applicability of the questionnaires by considering if the items are measurable in hospitals practically.
RESULTS: A close-ended, Likert-type scale items, consisted of ten sections, were developed based on project management body of knowledge thorough Delphi technique. It enables the managers to evaluate hospitals' situation to be aware whether the organization follows the knowledge management standards in innovation process or not. By pilot study, confirmatory factor analysis and exploratory factor analysis were conducted to ensure the validity and reliability of the measurement items.
CONCLUSION: The developed items seem to have a potential to help hospital managers and subsequently delivering new products/services successfully based on the standard procedures in their organization. In all innovation processes, the knowledge management areas and their standard steps help hospital managers by a new tool as questionnaire format.","AcknowledgementsThe authors gratefully acknowledge the contribution of Mr. Ali Forouzesh, the founder and CEO of Ofogh Project Management Institute regarding managing the meetings with a committee of professional project managers.",,Iranian Journal of Public Health,,,2017-12,2017,,2017-12,46,12,1639-1645,Closed,Article,"Ghasemi, Matina; Ghadiri Nejad, Mazyar; Bagzibagli, Kemal","Ghasemi, Matina (Faculty of Tourism, Eastern Mediterranean University, TRNC, Famagusta, Turkey.); Ghadiri Nejad, Mazyar (Young Researchers and Elite Club, South Tehran Branch, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran.); Bagzibagli, Kemal (Dept. of Economics, Faculty of Business and Economics, Eastern Mediterranean University, TRNC, Famagusta, Turkey.)",,"Ghasemi, Matina (); Ghadiri Nejad, Mazyar (Islamic Azad University, Tehran); Bagzibagli, Kemal ()",24,11,0.3,5.39,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1099599056,42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology; 4203 Health Services and Systems; 4206 Public Health,

These circumstances can result in a lack of information and support for people with dementia and their family caregivers at home. To increase the coordination between existing support services, so-called 'Dementia Care Networks' (DCNs) have been established. Most of the tasks that are performed in DCNs are based on communication strategies. Therefore, knowledge management (KM) is a key process in these networks. However, few studies have focused on this topic. This study attempted to evaluate KM strategies in DCNs across Germany as part of the DemNet-D study.
STUDY DESIGN: A qualitative interview study design was used.
METHODS: Qualitative data were collected during single and group interviews with key persons associated with thirteen DCNs. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed, and a structured content analysis was conducted. The framework for the analysis was derived from a KM model.
RESULTS: Information dissemination strategies for people with dementia and their informal caregivers based on actively established contacts appear to be more successful than passive strategies. General practitioners often play a key role as external gatekeepers in initiating contact between a network and a person affected by dementia. In this context, case managers can help integrate external stakeholders, such as general practitioners or pharmacists, into DCNs using different KM strategies. The systematic development of common objectives under an agency-neutral leadership seems to be an important aspect of successful KM within DCNs.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings reported here can help DCNs optimize their KM strategies for generating tailored information and support services for people with dementia living at home and their family caregivers. In particular, the identified potential knowledge distribution barriers and facilitators will be of practical use to DCN stakeholders.",,The study was funded by the German Ministry of Health in the line of the funding scheme âZukunftswerkstatt Demenzâ (grant numbers IIA5-2512FSB031; IIA5-2512FSB032).,Public Health,,Aged; Caregivers; Community Networks; Dementia; Germany; Humans; Information Dissemination; Knowledge Management; Qualitative Research; Residence Characteristics; Social Support,2015-12-21,2015,2015-12-21,2016-02,131,,40-48,Closed,Article,"Heinrich, S.; Uribe, F.

Methods: This research followed a rapid cross-sectional comparative design. Data were collected through an online survey targeting hospital associations. Eighteen of them shared information on their institutional profile, their areas of activity, their position and participation as policy actors before and during the COVID-19 crisis, the barriers and enablers affecting their participation and the impact of the crisis on their own financial situation.
Findings: We have documented a spectrum of situations both for national policy platforms and hospital associations. In some countries, there is the ideal match of well-established associations and national participatory health policy platforms. In others, hospital associations have modest staffing and may struggle to get access to policy platforms of importance. Being a well-established and respected contributor seems to have been an enabling factor for the contribution of the hospital associations to the COVID-19 response. For most associations, the crisis has led to an increased effort to be present in the policy arena; an issue they follow closely is the negative impact of the lockdown on the hospitals' revenue.
Conclusion: The growing pluralism characterizing our societies calls for the establishment of health policy platforms allowing for broader participation. Encouraging hospitals to set up their association for the latter to represent them in decision processes could be one of the components of the rebuilding of national health systems post pandemic.","Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: The International Hospital Federation (IHF) is a global not-for-profit, non-governmental membership organisation.

However, as emphasized in the contemporary agricultural history of Ethiopia, the most effective indigenous agricultural knowledge has not been well documented and some of them are replaced by modern techniques. This study was therefore conducted to assess and document community-based techniques to control pests and diseases and the practical implications of indigenous farming techniques. A focus group discussion, key informant interviews and semi-structured questionnaires were conducted with 150 farmers. The result showed that a substantial number (92%) of the farming community uses indigenous based plant protection measures. Indigenous farmers (92%) splash liquids made of cow urine to control the adverse effect of fungi. Farmers are also using different seed selection methods for next season planting. About 29% of the farmers do single head-based seed selection prior to mass harvesting, 34% are collected as ""Qerm"" and 45% select their seeds during threshing. Indigenous farming knowledge varies with the natural feature of the growing location and cropping system, including the rainfall pattern, soil fertility status, crop, and weed type. The observed positive effect of indigenous agricultural practices on crop production substantiates the need to include these essential approaches in the cultivation system along with the modern agronomic techniques. This might reduce the dependency on expensive and pollutant agricultural inputs. However, sociodemographic factors such as educational level, marital status and farming experience have been found as a determinant factor that influences utilization of indigenous farming knowledge. It can be therefore inferred that documenting indigenous knowledge and proving its applicability scientifically could contribute to organically oriented agricultural production and consequently reduce agriculture's contribution to environmental pollution.","We, the authors, are grateful for the farmers from the two communities for their interest to take part in the study and disclose their indigenous knowledge.","The authors acknowledged the financial support provided by Debark University, Ethiopia, with a grant number DKU001/11.",Heliyon,,,2023-01-14,2023,2023-01-14,2023-01,9,1,e12978,All OA; Gold,Article,"Melash, Anteneh Agezew; Bogale, Amare Assefa; Migbaru, Abeje Tafere; Chakilu, Gashaw Gismu; Percze, Attila; ÃbrahÃ¡m, Ãva Babett; Mengistu, Dejene K.","Melash, Anteneh Agezew (Department of Horticulture, College of Agriculture and Environmental Science, Debark University, P.O.

Knowledge of microbiomes, their systemic role, interactions, and impact grows exponentially. When a research field of importance for planetary health evolves so rapidly, it is essential to consider it from an ethical holistic perspective. However, to date, the topic of microbiome ethics has received relatively little attention considering its importance. Here, ethical analysis of microbiome research, innovation, use, and potential impact is structured around the four cornerstone principles of ethics: Do Good; Donât Harm; Respect; Act Justly. This simple, but not simplistic approach allows ethical issues to be communicative and operational. The essence of the paper is captured in a set of eleven microbiome ethics recommendations, e.g., proposing gut microbiome status as common global heritage, similar to the internationally agreed status of major food crops.",,All authors have received funding from the European Unionâs H2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant No. 818116 (MicrobiomeSupport).,Environmental Microbiome,,,2022-09-30,2022,2022-09-30,,17,1,50,All OA; Gold,Article,"Lange, Lene; Berg, Gabriele; Cernava, Tomislav; Champomier-VergÃ¨s, Marie-Christine; Charles, Trevor; Cocolin, Luca; Cotter, Paul; DâHondt, Kathleen; Kostic, Tanja; Maguin, Emmanuelle; Makhalanyane, Thulani; Meisner, Annelein; Ryan, Matthew; Kiran, George Seghal; de Souza, Rafael Soares; Sanz, Yolanda; Schloter, Michael; Smidt, Hauke; Wakelin, Steve; Sessitsch, Angela","Lange, Lene (LL-BioEconomy, Valby, Copenhagen, Denmark); Berg, Gabriele (Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria); Cernava, Tomislav (Graz University of Technology, Graz, Austria); Champomier-VergÃ¨s, Marie-Christine (INRAE, AgroParisTech, Micalis Institute, UniversitÃ© Paris-Saclay, Jouy-en-Josas, France); Charles, Trevor (University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada); Cocolin, Luca (University of Turin, Grugliasco, Italy); Cotter, Paul (Teagasc Food Research Centre, Moorepark, APC Microbiome Ireland and VistaMilk, Cork, Ireland); DâHondt, Kathleen (Department of Economy, Science and Innovation, Flemish Government, Brussels, Belgium); Kostic, Tanja (AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Tulln, Austria); Maguin, Emmanuelle (INRAE, AgroParisTech, Micalis Institute, UniversitÃ© Paris-Saclay, Jouy-en-Josas, France); Makhalanyane, Thulani (University of Pretoria, Pretoria, South Africa); Meisner, Annelein (Wageningen Research, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands); Ryan, Matthew (Genetic Resources Collection, CABI, Egham, UK); Kiran, George Seghal (Pondicherry University, Puducherry, India); de Souza, Rafael Soares (State University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil); Sanz, Yolanda (Institute of Agrochemistry and Food Technology- Spanish National Research Council (IATA-CSIC), Valencia, Spain); Schloter, Michael (Helmholtz Zentrum MÃ¼nchen, Oberschleissheim, Germany); Smidt, Hauke (Laboratory of Microbiology, Wageningen University & Research, Wageningen, The Netherlands); Wakelin, Steve (Scion, Christchurch, New Zealand); Sessitsch, Angela (AIT Austrian Institute of Technology GmbH, Tulln, Austria)","Lange, Lene ; Sessitsch, Angela (Austrian Institute of Technology)","Lange, Lene (); Berg, Gabriele (Graz University of Technology); Cernava, Tomislav (Graz University of Technology); Champomier-VergÃ¨s, Marie-Christine (Micalis Institute); Charles, Trevor (University of Waterloo); Cocolin, Luca (University of Turin); Cotter, Paul (Teagasc - The Irish Agriculture and Food Development Authority); DâHondt, Kathleen (Flemish Government); Kostic, Tanja (Austrian Institute of Technology); Maguin, Emmanuelle (Micalis Institute); Makhalanyane, Thulani (University of Pretoria); Meisner, Annelein (Wageningen University & Research); Ryan, Matthew (CAB International); Kiran, George Seghal (Pondicherry University); de Souza, Rafael Soares (State University of Campinas); Sanz, Yolanda (Instituto de AgroquÃ­mica y TecnologÃ­a de Alimentos); Schloter, Michael (Helmholtz Zentrum MÃ¼nchen); Smidt, Hauke (Wageningen University & Research); Wakelin, Steve (Scion); Sessitsch, Angela (Austrian Institute of Technology)",1,1,,,https://environmentalmicrobiome.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s40793-022-00444-y,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151496128,31 Biological Sciences; 3105 Genetics,

However, they encounter the difficulty of selecting suitable patents because the number of patents is increasingly large. Many patent recommendation methods have been proposed to ease the difficulty, but they ignore patent quality and cannot explain why certain patents are recommended. Patent quality and recommendation explanations affect companiesâ decision-making in the patent transfer context. Failing to consider them in the recommendation process leads to less effective recommendation results. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes an interpretable patent recommendation method based on knowledge graph and deep learning. The proposed method organizes heterogeneous patent information as a knowledge graph. Then it extracts connectivity and quality features from the knowledge graph for pairs of patents and companies. The former features indicate the relevance of the pairs while the latter features reflect the quality of the patents. Based on the features, we design an interpretable recommendation model by combining a deep neural network with a relevance propagation technique. We conduct experiments with real-world data to evaluate the proposed method. Recommendation lists with varying lengths show that the average precision, recall, and mean average precision of the proposed method are 0.596, 0.636, and 0.584, which improve corresponding performance of best baselines by 7.28%, 18.35%, and 8.60%, respectively. Besides, our method interprets recommendation results by identifying important features leading to the results.","We acknowledge the financial support from the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (No. 2022A1515011363), the Guangdong Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project (No.GD21CTS05), the Guangzhou Science and Technology Plan Project (No. 202002030384), and the 2021 Major Cultivation Project of Philosophy and Social Sciences in South China Normal University.",,Scientific Reports,,,2023-02-14,2023,2023-02-14,,13,1,2586,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chen, Han; Deng, Weiwei","Chen, Han (College of Teacher Education, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China); Deng, Weiwei (School of Economics and Management, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China)","Deng, Weiwei (South China Normal University)","Chen, Han (South China Normal University); Deng, Weiwei (South China Normal University)",0,0,,,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-28766-y.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155379609,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4605 Data Management and Data Science,

The small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have been impacted even more, due to their limited resources. Extant literature has prescribed many treatments on how SMEs could survive in post COVID-19 situation, but studies did not analyse how big data driven innovation could improve supply chain management (SCM) process in the post COVID-19 pandemic under the moderating influence of SME technology leadership support. Thus, there is a research gap in this important domain. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of big data driven innovation and technology capability of the SME on its supply chain system. The study also investigates the moderating role of SME technology leadership support on SME performance in the post COVID-19 scenario. With the help of literature and resource-based view (RBV) and dynamic capability view (DCV) theory, a theoretical model has been developed conceptually. Later the model is validated using structural equation modelling (SEM) technique with 327 usable respondents from SMEs from India. The study found that both big data driven innovation and the techno-functional capability of SME impacts supply chain capability which in turn impacts the SME performance in the post COVID-19 scenario. The study also finds that there will be a moderating impact of SME technology leadership support on SME performance.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Computers & Industrial Engineering,,,2022-03-04,2022,2022-03-04,2022-06,168,,108058,All OA; Green,Article,"Chatterjee, Sheshadri; Chaudhuri, Ranjan; Shah, Mahmood; Maheshwari, Pratik","Chatterjee, Sheshadri (Department of Computer Science & Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, West Bengal, India.); Chaudhuri, Ranjan (Department of Marketing, National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE), Mumbai, India.); Shah, Mahmood (Departmental Lead for Research, Newcastle, Business School, New Bridge Street, Newcastle-upon-Tyne NE1 8ST, UK.); Maheshwari, Pratik (Research scholar at National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE), Mumbai, India.)","Chaudhuri, Ranjan (National Institute of Industrial Engineering)","Chatterjee, Sheshadri (Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur); Chaudhuri, Ranjan (National Institute of Industrial Engineering); Shah, Mahmood (); Maheshwari, Pratik (National Institute of Industrial Engineering)",31,31,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9758005,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146049509,46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems,"9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The study of knowledge sharing in Saudi higher education is limited and offers little guidance to administrators, as well as faculty on how to capitalize on knowledge sharing and utilize it to their own and organizations' benefits. This research presents findings from an original quantitative study testing a structural equation model linking social cognitive theory to knowledge sharing collection and donation measured by validated scales from the extant literature. Community characteristics including altruism and reputation carry significant positive effects on knowledge sharing collection and donation. Similarly, personal outcomes expectations possess a moderate positive effect on knowledge sharing collection and donation. Self-efficacy in knowledge sharing emerged as an important predictor of knowledge sharing activities among Saudi academics. The findings suggest the need for developing professional training seminars on using social media for knowledge sharing in formal departmental and college settings. Further, the results confirm the relevance of social cognitive theory for the study of knowledge sharing. This creates the need for Saudi universities to invest in mentorship programs using digital platforms where personal and community outcomes' expectations are likely to improve among academics thereby increasing knowledge sharing activity.",The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Saud University for funding this work through research group No (RG-1441-527).

However, differences in the influence of different leadership styles on team knowledge sharing mechanism is still unclear. To understand different leadership style foster team knowledge sharing, this study focuses on leader-follower trust during team interactions. From the perspective of leadership as social problem solving, we argue that transformational leadership and authoritative leadership are different linked to team knowledge sharing. Through the collection of a sample of 791 valid questionnaires in China, we used the structural equation model to test the theoretical model. Results showed that: (1) Transformational leadership was positively linked to explicit and implicit knowledge sharing, while authoritative leadership was positively linked to explicit knowledge sharing. (2) Trust tendency mediates the relationship between authoritative leadership and knowledge sharing. (3) Supportive and bureaucratic culture moderate the influence of trust tendency on implicit knowledge sharing, such that the positive relationship is stronger for the low-quality of supportive culture and the high-quality of bureaucratic culture.

BACKGROUND: As the clinical leaders and future nurse manager candidates in the Chinese clinical setting, nurse champions are in great need of leadership and management competency training, but it is unclear what content should be included in the training curriculum, a guiding framework applicable to Chinese nurse champions was needed to be constructed.
METHODS: This study used a qualitative descriptive design to explore nurse champions' competency requirements from clinical nurse managers' perspective. Semi-structure interviews guided by the CNL competency matrix were conducted with 27 clinical nurse managers from six large-scale tertiary grade A hospitals in Shanghai, China. Interview transcripts were analysed using deductive and inductive content analysis.
RESULTS: The data analysis yielded three main categories: nursing leadership, clinical outcome management and care environment management, containing 14 subordinate themes, which represent the leadership and management competencies needed for nurse champions.
CONCLUSIONS: A leadership and management competency framework for Chinese nurse champion was built in this study, which covering the competencies needed by Chinese nurse champions to lead care teams, improve quality of care for patient outcomes and enhance systems and equipment for the better care environment. This framework will be the direct basis for guiding the development of the nurse leadership curriculum for driving nurse champion to achieve role success.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: This framework provides a theoretical foundation for clarifying the role of nurse champion in clinical management. Training curriculum guided by this framework will help nurses in their clinical management role and share the burden of clinical nursing managers, as well as promote the development of a clinical nursing management reserve talents and support the future development of nursing staff in health care organisations.",ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We extend our sincerest thanks to all the health care facilities that provided support and all the nurse managers interviewed.

In this article, we specify and implement a new algorithm for knowledge aggregation based on Nowak's psychological theory Regulatory Theory of Social Influence (RTSI). This theory posits that social influence consists of not only sources trying to influence targets, but also targets seeking sources by whom to be influenced and learning what processing rules those sources are using. A multi-agent simulator SMARTSIS is implemented to evaluate the algorithm, using as its base scenario a linear public goods game where the DIP's decision is a qualitative question of distributive justice. In a series of experiments examining the emergence of expertise, we show how RTSI enhances the effectiveness of the multi-agent DIP as a social group while conserving each agent's individual resources. Additionally, we identify eight criteria for evaluating the DIP unit's performance, consisting of four conflicting pairs of systemic drivers, and discuss how RTSI maintains a balanced tension between the four driver pairs through the emergence and divergence of expertise. We conclude by arguing that this shows how psychological theories like RTSI can have a crucial role in informing agent-based models of human behaviour, which in turn may be critically important for effective knowledge management and reflective self-improvement in both cyber-physical and socio-technical systems.",,,Artificial Life,,Humans; Learning; Cognition; Algorithms,2023-01-02,2023,2023-01-02,2023-01-02,29,1,37-65,Closed,Article,"Mertzani, Asimina; Pitt, Jeremy; Nowak, Andrzej; Michalak, Tomasz","Mertzani, Asimina (Imperial College London, Department of Electrical Electronic Engineering., asimina.mertzani20@imperial.ac.uk); Pitt, Jeremy (Imperial College London, Department of Electrical Electronic Engineering., j.pitt@imperial.ac.uk); Nowak, Andrzej (University of Warsaw, Robert B.
