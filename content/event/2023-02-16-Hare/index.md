abstract: "Acknowledging the contributions of university librarians in research is a growing practice. Librarians offer crucial support with the formulation of research methodologies and search strategies, result retrieval and screening, and the management of citations, and are often consulted throughout the research lifecycle on strategy and approaches to research. Additionally, librarians often advise diverse ranges of research teams, effectively cultivating their expertise in trends and knowledge gaps across fields, making them an invaluable resource for the conception and formulation of research projects. This research-in-progress aims to investigate how Canadian librarians are credited on journal publications. It will survey whether they are listed as co-authors or credited in acknowledgement sections. It will observe whether this practice is increasing over time, in which fields, and provide an overview of the current state of this practice in relation to Canadian librarians included in the recently developed Canadian Publications in Library and Information Science database."
