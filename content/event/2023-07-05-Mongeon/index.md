title: "Knowing thyself: Bibliometrics as knowledge management tools for research units and communities"
abstract: "Bibliometrics are widely used for information retrieval and for research evaluation at the individual (e.g., H-Index), journal (e.g., Impact Factor), or institutional level (e.g., University rankings). This presentation will demonstrate how bibliometrics, combined with network analysis and text-mining techniques, can also be an effective tool for understanding the structure of a body of literature and the knowledge it contains. This talk will demonstrate how individual researchers or research units can use bibliometrics to gain insights into their knowledge production and situate themselves within a broader knowledge context."
