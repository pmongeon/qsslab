date: 2021-10-31

"Dr. Philippe Mongeon, Director of the QSS lab, Dr. Alana Westwood (Lead PI) and Dr. Matthew Falconer received a SSHRC partnership development grant to investigate 
knowledge exchange at the environmental science-policy interface. 

The project involves academic partners (Dalhousie University, Carleton University, University of Alberta, University of New Brunswick, and University of Regina) 
as well as government partners (the Canadian Wildlife Service – Environment and Climate Change Canada, Natural Resources Canada, and the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat) 
and non-profit organizations (Mitacs and Evidence for Democracy).

The QSS Lab will lead the first of four research projects funded through this grant, which aims at analyzing the visibility/engagement with scholarly publications about forest science in publicly-available policy, news, and social media, and identify whether there are features, keywords, or subject areas that support greater uptake of forest science knowledge in these public venues.
