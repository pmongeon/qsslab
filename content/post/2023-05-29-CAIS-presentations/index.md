The 51st Annual Conference of the Canadian Association for Information Science/l’Association canadienne des sciences de l’information (CAIS/ACSI) will be taking place on June 6-9, 2023. Three members of QSSLab will be presenting their work at the conference as well as participating in the student research forum. 

[Geoff Krause](https://www.qsslab.ca/author/geoff-krause/) will be presenting the work "Measuring Data Reuse in OpenAlex by Researchers, Institutions, and Countries". **Abstract:** Open Data is a concept that is receiving increased attention and support in academic environments, with one justification being that shared data may be reused in further research. But what evidence exists for such reuse, and what is the relationship between the producers of shared datasets and researchers making use of them? This work in progress makes use of dataset citations in the OpenAlex bibliometric database to analyze the relationship between the creators of datasets and authors who cite them, at individual, institutional, and national levels.

[Marc-André Simard](https://www.qsslab.ca/author/marc-andre-simard/) will be presenting the work "The value of a diamond: Understanding global coverage of diamond Open Access journals in Web of Science, Scopus, and OpenAlex to support an open future". **Abstract:** Open Data is a concept that is receiving increased attention and support in academic environments, with one justification being that shared data may be reused in further research. But what evidence exists for such reuse, and what is the relationship between the producers of shared datasets and researchers making use of them? This work in progress makes use of dataset citations in the OpenAlex bibliometric database to analyze the relationship between the creators of datasets and authors who cite them, at individual, institutional, and national levels.

[Poppy Riddle](https://www.qsslab.ca/author/poppy-riddle/) will be presenting the work "The use of institutional Repository for self-archiving in Canadian Universities". **Abstract:** This study investigates the use of institutional repositories (IR) for self-archiving journal articles in the U15 universities as well as the presence of institutional policies and publisher embargoes. While 45.1% to 56.6% of publications are available in open access (OA), only 0.5% to 10.7% are found in the IRs. We found only three university-wide OA policies, and embargo periods of 12 months or more for 25.6% of journal policies. This suggests that IRs play a minor role in OA practices, and a need for more policies related to self-archiving and the use of IRs specifically.

The theme of this year's conference is "Imagining Information": attendees are invited to consider imagining in its many senses and forms, from imagining potential futures for the field and our society, to the nature and function of imagination in information experiences and phenomena. We are delighted that our lab members are contributing their expertise and thoughtful perspectives to imagining better futures for the IS field and for society.
