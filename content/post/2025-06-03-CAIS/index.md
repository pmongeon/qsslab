The Department of Information Science hosted the 53rd annual conference of the Canadian Association for Information Science (CAIS/ACSI) May 27-29th at the Faculty of Management, Dalhousie University. 

The conference featured 40 paper presentation and 16 posters, with 90 in-person attendees, and over 200 online participants.

Dr. Philippe Mongeon presented the article "A Bibliometric Analysis of Research by Canadian Library and Information Science Academics and Practitioners" authored by Jean-Sébastien Sauvé, Madelaine Hare, Geoff Krause, Constance Poitras, Poppy Riddle, and himself. Using data from the Canadian Publications in Library and Information Science Database, this study maps the scholarly contributions of Canadian LIS scholars and academic librarians to the field of LIS and examines whether Canadian LIS research is characterized by silos. This paper examines the similarities and differences in publications, impact, topics, and publication venues between academic librarians and scholars in Canada, as well as the extent to which academics and practitioners engage in research collaborations or reference each other’s work. Now published in the Canadian Journal of Information and Library Science, the full study can be read [here](https://doi.org/10.5206/cjils-rcsib.v48i1.22439). 

He also presented a work-in-progress by himself, Madelaine Hare, Geoff Krause, Rebecca Marjoram, Poppy Riddle, Rémi Toupin, and Summer Wilson entitled "Investigating Document Type Discrepancies between OpenAlex and the Web of Science", which aims to assess the metadata quality of works in OpenAlex and the Web of Science.
